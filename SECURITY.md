# Security and Responsible Disclosure Policy
Review the HHS Disclosure Policy and websites in scope:
[https://www.hhs.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/index.html).

This policy describes *what systems and types of research* are covered under this
policy, *how to send* us vulnerability reports, and *how long* we ask security
researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.
