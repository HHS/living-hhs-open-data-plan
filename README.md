### The value of HHS Open Data is far reaching:

* **Eliminate silos to improve operational efficiencies**: Streamline data-sharing processes across HHS divisions to reduce redundancies and enhance program effectiveness.
* **Drive new business models**: Enable public-private partnerships that leverage HHS data to create innovative solutions for healthcare and human services.
* **Fuel American innovation**: Provide researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers with access to high-value datasets that catalyze advancements in science, technology, and public health.
* **Accelerate scientific breakthroughs**: Facilitate the use of real-world data to inform research and evidence-based policy decisions.
* **Demystify government with transparency**: Embrace open methods, work in the open, and pull back the curtain on who, what, where, when, why, and how HHS operates.
* **Maximize taxpayers’ return on investment (ROI) on HHS data investments**: Ensure that every dollar spent on data collection and management delivers measurable benefits to the American people.

This multi-year Living Plan details how HHS intends to use data in service of its mission to enhance the health and well-being of all Americans. As part of this document, HHS explains the reasons why the Living HHS Open Data Plan exists and the rules it must follow for implementation success, while sharing credit with the HHS team that worked hard to create it.
