# Living HHS Open Data Plan
Welcome to the Living HHS Open Data Plan! This community serves as a mechanism for HHS and public users collaborate, share ideas, and dynamically contribute to this "living" 
document.  

The Living Open Data Plan here on GitHub introduces a dynamic, modular approach to data management, fostering collaboration and eliminating silos across HHS operating 
divisions. Co-authored and co-created with input from all HHS Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions, the Living Open Data Plan is united by shared values of transparency, 
purpose, relentless optimization, excellence, respect, and integrity that are foundational to the Open Data community.  

Through its Open Data approach, HHS aims to demystify and encourage the U.S. healthcare system to leverage high-quality data to create innovative ecosystems that benefit 
patients—all while exercising the highest standards of privacy protection. The HHS Open Data community will accomplish this by working with the public to:

* Eliminate silos to reduce redundancies and enhance operational efficiency across divisions.
* Fuel innovation by providing researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers with access to high-value datasets that catalyze advancements in science, technology, and public
  health.
* Accelerate scientific breakthroughs by using real-world data to inform evidence-based research and policy decisions. 
* Maximize taxpayers’ ROI to ensure every taxpayer dollar spent on data collection delivers measurable benefits to the American people. 
* Fuel public-private partnerships to foster collaboration across sectors, solve real-world challenges, and deliver measurable impact with greater efficiency. 
* Engage the public to collaboratively “co-create” by providing input and feedback to ensure the Living HHS Open Data Plan is constantly improving.
