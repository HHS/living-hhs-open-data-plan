## Unified HHS for Data Sharing  

HHS must come together as one department for successful data lifecycle management that responsibly unlocks HHS Open Data for the public. The nation’s health and human services needs are complex—and public health problems are rarely solved by a single federal initiative. Although data is a critical strategic asset for advancing public health, data sharing and interoperability are critical to making people healthier.   

As such, HHS embraces the opportunity to transform itself into an agile Department, responsive to the nation’s needs, by leveraging the power of the information available across its multi-agency data assets. Contributors to this Living Plan included staff from all HHS divisions, which are listed in the acronyms of Appendix A. This Living Plan will be updated in alignment with new HHS office structures, as new information becomes known about reorganizations.
