## Unified HHS for Data Sharing  

HHS must come together as one department for successful data lifecycle management that responsibly unlocks HHS Open Data for the public. The nation’s health and human 
services needs are complex—and public health problems are rarely solved by a single federal initiative. Although data is a critical strategic asset for advancing public 
health, data sharing and interoperability are critical to making people healthier.  

As such, HHS embraces the opportunity to transform itself into an agile Department, responsive to the nation’s needs, by leveraging the power of the information available 
across its multi-agency data assets. Contributors to this Living Plan included HHS staff from:  

1. __Office of the Secretary and Administration for a Healthy America__ (AHA) including:
