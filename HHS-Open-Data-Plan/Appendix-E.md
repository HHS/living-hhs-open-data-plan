## Appendix E: Novel Models of Data Governance: Inspired by Tribal Data Governance for Radical, Collective, Self-Governance

HHS expects to explore novel models of data governance, including radical, collective, self-governance models with sovereign nations, patient communities, and external sources.  

The thoughtful collection, sharing, and use of Open Data to advance HHS missions requires transparency in data governance that engenders trust by design, ensuring that the 
right people have access to the right data at the right time. Governance of data requires a close interplay between data sharing and access policies, and the technologies that 
enable the management and sharing of data through secure infrastructures. Included in these considerations are the responsible management and sharing of data contributed from 
American Indians and Alaska Natives (Indigenous data). As a model, Indigenous data are governed by and intrinsic to Indigenous Peoples’ capacity and capability to realize their
human rights and reflect the crucial role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination. The governance of these data has been articulated through the CARE 
principles[^42], which emphasize the need for tribal data sovereignty over access and future use, among other principles. By aligning with the CARE principles, NIH has 
implemented a tribally governed data infrastructure[^43] that allows for federated tribal data sovereignty, giving each participating tribal community full control over the 
access and management of their data, thus ensuring that tribal data is owned and controlled by the tribes and the right people have access at the right time.
