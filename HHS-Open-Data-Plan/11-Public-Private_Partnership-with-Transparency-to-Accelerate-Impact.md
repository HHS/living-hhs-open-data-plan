## Public/Private Partnership with Transparency to Accelerate Impact

HHS is a federal agency with gift authority[^71], so the Department may accept gifts and financial resources from external sources. Public-private partnerships have emerged as a powerful mechanism for addressing complex challenges in health, science, and human services for public good—yet such partnerships must be coupled with HHS transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens.

Collaborative ventures between government agencies, private sector entities, and non-profit organizations offer a unique approach to leveraging diverse expertise, resources, and perspectives to drive innovation and improve public health outcomes. In the context of health and human services, both informal collaborations and formal partnerships are valuable for their ability to expand the solution space, pool resources, grow expertise, harness big data, and promote data sharing across sectors for a more holistic approach to public health and human services.  

By combining the strengths of public and private entities, partnerships like the [LymeX public-private partnerships](https://www.lyme-x.org/)[^72] accelerate progress and move the needle on HHS priorities—like MAHA chronic conditions—with greater efficacy than either sector could achieve alone. For example, a partnership between a government health agency and a private healthcare technology company could result in the development of innovative telemedicine solutions that extend healthcare access to underserved rural communities. The public sector brings regulatory knowledge and population health data, while the private sector contributes technological expertise, agile development processes, and community trust because external groups are often more directly connected than HHS to local community needs. Working together creates a synergy with mutual benefits.

HHS and its partners must execute collaborative efforts within a shared framework that safeguards individual privacy, maintains confidentiality and integrity, and ensures data security while also “sharing by default” and “open by default” per the Evidence Act.  

Partnerships vary by use case and context matters. No matter the context, however, HHS partnerships adhere to all applicable  federal privacy laws (e.g., HIPAA), statutes and regulations—simultaneously balancing  radical transparency for public visibility and accountability.  
 
With ethical implementation and ethical modernization, HHS partnerships can strengthen community relationships and foster public trust in government to achieve shared goals, as they optimize the societal benefits through innovative partnerships fueled by HHS Open Data. Well-managed partnerships include protective measures and best practices for open government transparency, co-creation, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens so that all HHS partners harness the power of cross-sector collaboration, while maintaining the highest standards of ethical and legal compliance. All stakeholders—including the public—deserve to have full visibility into an HHS partnership's objectives, methods, progress, and challenges to foster trust and enable continuous improvement through open feedback and scrutiny.  

HHS guidelines on public-private partnerships fueled by HHS Open Data do not yet exist, yet the community identified these key measures to maximize the chances of success for public good:  

1. **Clear separation of roles**: Regulatory functions remain strictly within the purview of HHS Divisions with clearly defined responsibilities and roles of each partner.  
2. **Public interest committees**: Independent committees, including public representatives, oversee partnerships to ensure they consistently prioritize public benefit over private interests, while adhering to FACA and other applicable laws, statutes, and regulations.  
3. **Transparent decision-making**: All major decisions are made through open processes, with an a priori appellate process defined, mutually agreed rationales, and potential conflicts of interest fully disclosed.  
4. **Regular public reporting**: Detailed reports on partnership activities, outcomes, and financial arrangements are made publicly available on a frequent basis.
5. **Ethical guidelines**: Strict ethical guidelines govern all aspects of the partnership, with clear consequences for violations.  
6. **Term limits and rotation**: Partnerships have defined terms and regular rotation of private partners to prevent entrenchment of interests.

HHS is redefining partnerships with transparency by moving beyond Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) and information sharing to actively co-create open platforms with U.S. citizens, patients, and stakeholders as equal partners. This collaborative approach enables the development of data-driven projects, such as real-time tracking of milestones, public forums for strategy discussions, and mechanisms for direct citizen input into decision-making. By embracing this level of openness and implementing safeguards against regulatory capture, public-private partnerships not only enhance their effectiveness but also set new benchmarks for accountability. This ensures that the interests of all stakeholders—especially the public—remain at the forefront of these initiatives.
