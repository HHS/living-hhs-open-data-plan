HHS is trusted with personal data by all Americans, patients, and clinicians alike. HHS must honor that trust, by keeping data private, while delivering value and 
rewarding individuals for investing their data and digital stories with us. The HHS Open Data approach ensures that the healthcare system is fully informed with HHS data, 
ensuring that patients benefit from downstream data marketplace and ecosystems, while balancing the need to minimize unnecessary risks to the individual, including privacy 
harms and confidentiality, embracing our responsibilities.  

Change will move at the speed of trust. Trust may be defined as “consistency over time” and this Living Plan acknowledges that HHS can do more to build trust in the 
ecosystem. Rebuilding and strengthening the public’s trust in HHS data is paramount for HHS Open Data success, and change is here. In 2025, HHS recommits to reliably 
sharing high-quality data, consistently engaging with radical transparency, adopting “open” methods (e.g., [Open Science](https://www.science.gov/), 
[Open Innovation](https://challenge.gov/), [Open Source Code](https://github.com/HHS)), and openly 
communicating with opportunities for two-way public engagements, events, and public-private partnerships.  

### Open Methods to Improve the Living HHS Open Data Plan  

This Living Plan satisfies Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements for the Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (Evidence Act) of 2018 Title II—also known as the 
Open, Public, Electronic, and Necessary (OPEN) Data Government Act—but its purpose transcends mere box-checking. When Open Data is reduced to a compliance task, 
organizations lose the transformative spirit of transparency and collaboration. Impactful Open Data requires a cultural shift at every level of an organization, embracing 
a mindset of “share by default” and “open by default” to democratize access to information as a public good. By distributing power to the people, the future of HHS Open 
Data aims to empower Americans with timely, machine-readable, high-quality, freely available data from all HHS Divisions, while lifting new data governance models to give 
U.S. citizens and patients more agency and control over their own data.  

This Living HHS Open Data Plan is designed to evolve with public input and feedback. It is modular, so each chapter is its own independent GitHub file for the public to 
submit issues and ideas, in response to a general HHS request for public input and comments. The HHS GitHub “Tell Us About Your Experience with the HHS Open Data Plan” is 
an online form with open-ended space for public response. With this agile approach, HHS aims to avoid the pitfalls of bureaucratic compliance while maintaining focus on 
the ultimate goal: fostering collaboration and unlocking the transformative power of data for operational efficiency, scientific discovery, innovation, and public impact.  

The value of HHS Open Data is far reaching:  
- __Eliminate silos to improve operational efficiencies:__ Streamline data-sharing processes across divisions to reduce redundancies and enhance program effectiveness.  
-   __Drive new business models:__ Enable public-private partnerships that leverage HHS data to create innovative solutions for healthcare and human services.  
-   __Fuel American innovation:__ Provide researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers with access to high-value datasets that catalyze advancements in science, technology,
and public health.  
-   __Accelerate scientific breakthroughs:__ Facilitate the use of real-world data to inform evidence-based research and policy decisions.  
-   __Demystify government with transparency:__ Embrace open methods, work in the open, and pull back the curtain on who, what, where, when, why, and how HHS operates.  
-   __Maximize taxpayers’ ROI on HHS data investments:__ Ensure that every dollar spent on data collection and management delivers measurable benefits to the American people.  

### Everyday Leadership: Driving Open Data Transformation  

Achieving the goals of the Living Plan requires sustained effort and action across all levels of the HHS workforce. Leadership, managers, data stewards, and staff must 
integrate data into everyday decision-making. We must all foster a culture where data-guided insights drive understanding and impact. HHS Open Data transformation begins 
with everyday leadership, where every Federal employee can commit to lead by example and work in the open with transparency to expand trust in the agency, in science, and 
in the data stewarded by HHS. We can all say “yes” by default to responsible data sharing requests, so that historical gatekeeping norms and gatekeeping culture across HHS 
will be transformed into a data-driven, enabling culture without silos.  

### Everyone Included: Valuing All Perspectives  

The success of the Living Plan depends on a collective effort across the entire HHS workforce—data stewards, scientists, strategists, communicators, administrators, problem 
solvers, and innovators—with everyone recommitting to transparency, HHS data, and following the data, wherever the data and science lead. Moreover, HHS must be responsive to 
the American public’s needs, requests, and suggestions for improving the Living Plan, [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/) resources, and Departmental initiatives.  

Across all HHS bureaucracy levels in day-to-day work, employees are encouraged to enable a “yes” by default data-sharing culture with transparency to eliminate information 
silos, while actively answering. All HHS staff can aid this transformation by asking themselves the following three questions.  

__1. How can I responsibly publish more “open by default” data on [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/)?__  
Remember, the public has a legal right to federal data when expected societal benefits/rewards outweigh expected costs/risks (e.g., balancing accessibility and security 
while ensuring quality, ethical use, and protection of priority data assets).

__2. How can I more transparently engage, listen, and respond to citizens and public feedback?__  
Remember, the Evidence Act mandates “open by default” data and HHS policy advances open science (free public access without paywalls), and successful delivery involves 
two-way public engagements with responsiveness to citizens. 

__3. How do I ensure, measure, and track real-world impact from my HHS data work?__  
Responsible data sharing with a “yes” enabling culture is a good step and necessary—yet insufficient—to transform raw data into understanding and insights to guide decisions 
and actions. All data projects should explicitly define measurable metrics of success that matter to the American people. As civil servants working on HHS data projects, we 
must hold ourselves accountable to these measurable metrics of success that will vary by project, so that HHS data efforts will directly improve service delivery with 
positive outcomes to U.S. health and human lives.  

Lastly, HHS Open Data is not just about numbers; it is about the people with the human dimensions. With a holistic view of data science, HHS must prioritize the lifting of 
people and sharing data-driven stories. “[Stories are data with a soul](https://healthdata.gov/),” to paraphrase Brené Brown, and the 2025 HealthData.gov refresh features stories to connect our HHS 
data with collective purpose.  

By addressing the above questions and embracing a culture of transparency, collaboration, and accountability, HHS commits to unlocking the full potential of its data to 
enhance the health and well-being of all Americans. Join us!
