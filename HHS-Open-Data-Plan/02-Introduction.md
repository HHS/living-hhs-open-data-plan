## Message from the HHS Chief Data Officer—People First, Data Always!

Fifteen years ago, HHS led the federal Open Data movement and launched HealthData.gov, the home of HHS Open Data. With the publication of this Open Data Plan and 
a refreshed HealthData.gov launched in July 2025, HHS has refocused its efforts on open data and delivered on three milestones.   
1. HHS Open Data Plan (this document 
2. HHS Metadata Standard (version 1.0)
3. HHS Data Inventory (version 1.0 metadata catalog of public and non-public data assets)

American taxpayers fund HHS data and information, making it essential that these resources are democratized—easily discoverable, machine-readable, and freely accessible 
to all. All Americans have a right to the information that underpins the Department’s operations, federally funded research, and broader “open” initiatives including 
partnerships, citizen science, crowdsourcing, prizes, and innovation challenges fueled by HHS Open Data. With the maturation of multiple open communities, HHS is poised 
in 2025 to link synergistic ecosystems for increased impact.
- Open Data: [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) and [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/)
- Open Government: [Open.USA.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/us-open-government)
- Open Innovation: [Challenge.gov](https://challenge.gov/)
- Open Science: [Science.gov](https://www.science.gov/)
- Open Source Code: [Code.gov](https://code.gov/) and [HHS GitHub repo](https://github.com/HHS)

HHS will improve its ability to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decisions across all levels of the Department. To support this, the HHS Chief Data 
Officer (CDO) collaborated with data leaders to define shared values for navigating future challenges and change. While the HHS workforce, interagency partners, and 
external collaborators may differ on data priorities or interpretations, we can all unite around values that drive progress and collaboration with a “sharing by default” 
culture and “open by default” data ethos.

Core values underpin the HHS Open Data community, underlying every aspect of this plan.  
1. **TRANSPARENCY:** Radical openness by default.
2. **PURPOSE:** Data that serves the public good.
3. **RELENTLESS OPTIMIZATION:** Adapt, refine, and improve using agile methods, two-way feedback, a growth mindset, and accountability.
4. **EXCELLENCE:** Real-world evidence drives impact.
5. **RESPECT:** People and patients as equal partners.
6. **INTEGRITY:** Find the truth. Tell the truth.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the HHS Open Data ecosystem—a community of solvers, collaboratively co-creating a more transparent, accountable, and responsive HHS. Today, we have incredible opportunity to responsibly share data, eliminate silos, modernize government, and drive progress through partnerships and emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). All are welcome—join us! People first, data always!
