## Data Usage Information

As part of the HealthData.gov refresh in July 2025, HHS introduced two new pages to provide greater transparency into how the public interacts with its Open Data resources. These pages offer valuable insights into data usage trends, helping both HHS and the public better understand the reach and impact of HHS Open Data.  
- [HealthData.gov Analytics](https://healthdata.gov/stories/s/analytics/wdv7-jy83)[^55]: Summarizes public usage statistics for HealthData.gov and its Open Data resources. These analytics focus exclusively on public interactions, offering a clear picture of how HHS datasets are accessed and utilized.
- [Top-1000 Open Data Resources and Websites](https://healthdata.gov/stories/s/top_1000/tphk-awim)[^56]: Dynamically generated in near-real time using the U.S. General Services Administration’s (GSA) Digital Analytics Program (DAP)[^57], this Top-1000 page highlights the most visited HHS websites and data resources. This list filters GSA’s DAP data to include only HHS resources, showcasing popular Open Data and Open Science resources and websites across all HHS Divisions. Users can filter the list by HHS Divisions or table columns to explore specific data usage trends.

Both HHS tools enable the public and federal agencies to understand how the public finds, accesses, and uses HHS Open Data, online resources, and websites. Data usage information is shared in an anonymous way, as it includes only summary statistics. This reflects HHS’s unwavering commitment to protect individual privacy and ensure compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and other applicable federal laws, statutes, and regulations.  

**Protecting Privacy and Ensuring Compliance**: In data usage tracking efforts, HHS maintains an unwavering commitment to protecting individual privacy and ensuring compliance with all applicable federal laws, statutes, and regulations. Data usage information is collected, de-identified for protection of individual privacy, and analyzed in aggregate form, with stringent measures in place to prevent the identification of individual users or the compromise of potentially sensitive information.

**Tracking and Analytics to Inform Decision Making**: Insights gleaned from HHS data usage information inform HHS policymaking and resource allocation. By understanding which websites and datasets are most frequently accessed and how they are being used, HHS can better align Open Data efforts with public needs and scientific research priorities.

**Transparency and Reporting**: HHS regularly publishes reports on data usage statistics and trends[^58][^59][^60]. These reports provide valuable insights to both internal stakeholders and the public, fostering a culture of openness and accountability in our data management practices.

**Collaborations and Partnerships for Enhanced Insights**: To extract additional understanding and value from HHS data usage information, HHS engages in strategic collaborations through the CDO Council, other federal agencies, and public-private partnerships. Such collaborations enable a more sophisticated analysis of data usage trends, many of which are available on Data.gov[^61] and GSA’s DAP[^62].

[^58]: Data Quality Guidelines ensure transparency around the quality of official statistics ([FCSM-20-04 A Framework for Data Quality](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fcsm.gov%2Fassets%2Ffiles%2Fdocs%2FFCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf&data=05%7C02%7Cclaire.german%40hhs.gov%7Cdba1e8d1bf0a4e5fbfd608ddb8c1977a%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C638869863799804955%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=soqmT4Yq%2BzO6CwKh%2BDGGUhoDuDyLg5xtnP29FC2Da%2Fw%3D&reserved=0))

HHS communicates the usage and value of its data at public-facing engagements and events including technology sprints, innovation sprints, demo days, and other opportunities that showcase data usage information. HHS features select data usage information through the [HealthData.gov/stories](https://healthdata.gov/browse?limitTo=story)[^63], also known as the HealthData.gov blog.

Data usage information must guide the HHS Open Data Plan and future strategy, illuminating the path to maximum efficiency, economic growth, scientific discovery, and public impact. By tracking and analyzing how HHS data is accessed and utilized, we transform raw statistics into actionable insights. The HHS CDO will develop a detailed multi-year schedule (beyond Table 1 - HHS Open Data Action Plan, pages 9–10) for implementation, following the Department’s reorganization.
