## Data Usage Information

HHS data usage statistics are available at [https://healthdata.gov/metrics](https://healthdata.gov/metrics). The top 1,000 data assets are dynamically displayed and easily 
discoverable on the HHS Open Data Resources page at [URL link]. HHS is also part of the U.S. General Services Administration 
[Digital Analytics Program (DAP)](https://digital.gov/guides/dap)[^26] that enables federal agencies to understand how the public finds, accesses, and uses government 
services online.  

Data usage information is anonymous, as it includes only summary statistics. This reflects HHS’s unwavering commitment to protect individual privacy and ensure compliance 
with the Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other federal regulations.  

__Protecting Privacy and Ensuring Compliance:__ In data usage tracking efforts, HHS maintains an unwavering commitment to protecting individual privacy and ensuring 
compliance with HIPAA and all federal regulations. Data usage information is collected, de-identified for protection of individual privacy, and analyzed in aggregate form, 
with stringent measures in place to prevent the identification of individual users or the compromise of sensitive information.

__Tracking and Analytics to Inform Decision Making:__ Insights gleaned from HHS data usage information inform HHS policy-making and resource allocation. By understanding 
which websites and datasets are most frequently accessed and how they are being used, HHS can better align Open Data efforts with public needs and scientific research 
priorities.

__Transparency and Reporting:__ HHS regularly publishes reports on data usage statistics and trends[^27][^28][^29]. These reports provide valuable insights to both internal 
stakeholders and the public, fostering a culture of openness and accountability in our data management practices.

__Collaborations and Partnerships for Enhanced Insights:__ To extract additional understanding and value from HHS data usage information, HHS engages in strategic 
collaborations through the CDO Council, other federal agencies, and public-private partnerships. Such collaborations enable a more sophisticated analysis of data usage 
trends, many of which are available on Data.gov[^30] and the interagency Digital Analytics Program (DAP)[^31].

HHS communicates the usage and value of its data at public-facing engagements and events including technology sprints, innovation sprints, demo days, and other opportunities 
that showcase data usage information. HHS features select data usage information through the HealthData.gov/stories , also known as the HealthData.gov blog.  

Data usage information must guide the HHS Open Data strategy, illuminating the path to maximum efficiency, economic growth, scientific discovery, and public impact. By 
tracking and analyzing how HHS data is accessed and utilized, we transform raw statistics into actionable insights. See Appendix C – HHS Open Data Action Items with 
Timeline, for the Living HHS Open Data action plan with 2025 – 2028 timeline.
