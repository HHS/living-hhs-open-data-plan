## Public Engagement with, by, and for We the People

HHS uses numerous mechanisms to engage with the public for sharing data and information (so that the public can better access and use public data assets), to collaborate on data-related work where there are common interests, and/or to maintain an open dialogue between HHS and the public when critical perspectives and other input is needed. Department-wide “open” engagement outlets commonly used by all HHS divisions include:   

- Open Data: [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) and [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/)  
- Open Government: [Open.USA.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/us-open-government)  
- Open Innovation: [Challenge.gov](https://challenge.gov/)  
- Open Science: [Science.gov](https://www.science.gov/)  
- Open Source Code: [Code.gov](https://code.gov/) and [HHS GitHub repo](https://github.com/HHS)  

Additional opportunities for public engagement include:

Web Interfaces for Data Sharing: HHS publicly shares information and data through the Open Data catalog on HealthData.gov (and other open catalogs), the HHS Data Inventory, Dashboards, Search Tools, and APIs such as the ones listed on the [HHS CDO Open Data Inventories and APIs page](https://cdo.hhs.gov/s/open-data)[^73]—and through resources like its [Tribal Data Homepage](https://cdo.hhs.gov/s/tribal-data)[^74] and [GitHub site](https://github.com/hhs/)[^75].

**Feedback and Input**: HHS shares with the public its agency [policies and procedures](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/data/information-quality-guidelines) related to maintenance of information quality—providing opportunities for the public to give HHS feedback and request clarity/corrections. HHS also engages with the public through mechanisms such as the [Secretary’s Tribal Advisory Committee](https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/tribal-affairs/about-stac/index.html)[^76] and other Federal Advisory Committees mandated by the U.S. Congress and managed by HHS.

**Formal Collaborations and Partnerships**: HHS builds cross-agency data [capacity for comparative clinical effectiveness research](https://aspe.hhs.gov/collaborations-committees-advisory-groups/os-pcortf), works with surveillance and research partners through cooperative agreements such as [these at the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/funding/index.html), and offers [technical assistance and other resources](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/health-equity/minority-health/equity-programs/technical-assistance) to help others use HHS data to make the nation healthier. Such formal partnerships include legally binding relationships between HHS and external entities.  

**Informal Collaborations with Communities**: HHS hosts events like the Health Datapalooza[^77] that originated out of the Department to showcase the value of Open Data for health and human services. HHS also hosts Open Data roundtables, hackathons, “[healthathons](https://health.gov/about-oash/io-programs-initiatives/innovationx/health-human-centered-design/health-long-covid)[^78]”, DataJams, Demo Days, Innovation Sprints, Tech Sprints like [TOP/TOPx](https://opportunity.census.gov/)[^79], and other public engagements fueled by HHS Open Data. Other mechanisms involve [listening sessions and interviews](https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/public-health-strategy/public-health-strategies-for-community-health-assessment-data-benchmarks.html)[^80] to monitor HHS progress and understand HHS effectiveness, given evolving community needs and wishes. These informal engagements are lightweight, flexible engagements that do not require legally binding relationships between HHS and external entities.

The HHS Open Data community embraces agile methods. Agile methods include human-centered design and qualitative research, which helps to lift the lived experiences and interdisciplinary sciences with consideration of medical ethics and ethical modernization.  

Open data excellence is a shared effort that will improve with your input and iterating collaboratively with this Living Plan. HHS welcomes and values input from all the public across all sectors. Cross-sector lessons learned and insights will improve HHS efforts to responsibly unlock data, share information, and deliver mission while following the data wherever the data lead.
