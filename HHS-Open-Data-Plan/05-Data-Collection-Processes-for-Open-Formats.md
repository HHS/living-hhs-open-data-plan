## Data Collection Processes for Open Formats

HHS is committed to transforming its data collection processes to meet the highest standards of accessibility, usability, and interoperability. By adopting open formats, 
HHS ensures its data is machine-readable, fostering transparency, operational efficiency, and innovation in alignment with the OPEN Government Data Act. To maximize the 
value of its data, HHS has embraced the **FAIR-D principles—Findable[^2], Accessible[^3], Interoperable[^4], Reusable[^4], and Delightful[^5][^6], (FAIR-D)**—establishing 
secure, trustworthy, and open-by-default practices. Standardizing procedures and prioritizing Open Data not only increases public access but also drives innovation, economic 
growth, and accountability. This commitment strengthens government operations, builds public trust, and advances HHS’s mission to improve the health and well-being of all 
Americans.

### Completed Projects

Open Data collection practices are on-going with continuous improvements (marked with asterisk*) to select HHS completed projects:

- **Envisioned and launched HealthData.gov[^7]*** 15 years ago, spearheading the federal Open Data movement prior to Data.gov, as the home of government Open Data.
  - **Open.FDA.gov[^8]**, publishes usage metrics since its launch, similar to HealthData.gov with digital analytics and metrics. This has helped FDA build awareness on
      the value of the public data sets to drive innovation and effectiveness of initiatives targeting adverse events, drug shortages, food/product recalls, and FDA
      regulatory decisions.
- **Pioneered responsible data sharing practices[^9]*** in both Open Data and Open Science, developing risk-informed approaches to weigh and balance the expected societal
  rewards/benefits of information disclosures with the expected societal risks/costs.
- **Delivered U.S. Open Government[^10]** progress through Open Data and data-driven innovation by listening and responding to citizens’ campaigns that catalyzed HHS action
  to address America’s opioid crisis, suicide prevention, and Lyme and tick-borne diseases.
- **Enhanced Transparency and Accessibility of Federal Spending Data through the DATA Act** by implementing an automated monthly process to report contracts, grants, and
  financial assistance spending data to [USASpending.gov](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usaspending.gov%2F&data=05%7C02%7CKristen.Honey%40hhs.gov%7Ca4e2e8456abf4fa66c9c08ddbe27a3dc%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C638875799635902074%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=uyAZEHnhVIt1DIzoBJ8lCY2fjVnLLPBKkrkGDsNgA2E%3D&reserved=0)[^11]
 	consistent with the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act)[^12] strengthening data integrity and resulting in transparency to the public regarding how
 	federal dollars are spent.
- **Harnessed the power of Open Data to fuel American Innovation and Open innovation*** and HHS has run more innovation challenges and prizes than all other federal
  agencies[^13]. 
- **Unlocked information for all citizens through Open Science***, with HHS housing Science.gov[^14] and PubMed[^15] with over 38 million citations for biomedical literature
  with underlying data available to everyone without paywalls[^16]. See the Open Science Disclosure Risk Management: A Workshop Report and Corresponding Recommendations for
 	the	Federal Research Community[^17] in Appendix B (Open Science Disclosure Risk Management (2019 NSTC SOS)).
- **Pioneered Public Engagements, Health Datapaloozas[^18], and Tech Sprints like TOP/TOPx[^19]*** to showcase and celebrate Open Data for impact using a variety of HHS tech
  sprints, innovation sprints, hackathons, “Healthathons,” Datapaloozas, and other public-facing engagements with events fueled by [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/),
 	the home of HHS Open Data.
- **Published a HHS Metadata Standard***—accompanying this Living Plan in July 2025—with a public call-to-action for feedback to improve the standard with future iterations.
- **Published the HHS Data Inventory***—accompanying this Living Plan in July 2025—with a public call-to-action to establish a comprehensive metadata inventory of public and
  non-public data assts managed by HHS in machine-readable, open formats.
- **Published the Living HHS Open Data Plan***—this document with accompanying [GitHub Living HHS Open Data Plan](https://github.com/HHS/hhs-open-data-plan) for two-way,
  open, public suggestions for continuous improvements. Please let HHS know of other completed projects with public benefit that are missing and should be featured in the
 	Living HHS Open Data Plan.

### HHS 2025 Initiatives and Next Steps

Building upon past achievements, the HHS CDO and data leaders across the Department expect to implement a series of Open Data initiatives in 2025 and beyond:  

*	**Eliminate Information Silos:** In collaboration with HHS leadership, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and the Chief AI Officer (CAIO), the HHS CDO is harnessing the power
  of HHS Open Data to dismantle barriers to interagency and intra-agency data sharing, creating a “sharing by default” culture across the entire department. Open Data must
 	enable collaboration, improve efficiency, and enhance transparency to achieve U.S. goals outlined in Executive Order 14243: Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse[^20][^21],
 	OMB guidance, and HHS Secretary priorities including Make America Health Again (MAHA)[^22][^23][^24], Open Data.
*	**Unlock Real-World Data for Impact:** The CDO will focus resources on MAHA priorities, including lifecycle data management and sharing HHS Open Data for public health
  priorities like the chronic disease crisis. 
*	**Publish a Comprehensive HHS Data Inventory with DCAT-U.S. 3.0:** The CDO and data leaders will continue to build open APIs and machine-readable resources for the public
  to use the comprehensive HHS Data Inventory, using DCAT-U.S. 3.0 standards. The HHS Data Inventory includes public and non-public data assets from all Operating Divisions
 	and Staff Divisions, giving HHS employees and the public access to a single enterprise inventory in one place for the whole Department to make HHS data discoverable,
 	sharable, (re)useable, and transformed into understanding to guide decisions and actions. 
*	**Review, Streamline, and Improve HHS Data Policy:** In collaboration with HHS leadership, the CXOs—HHS CTO, HHS CAIO, and HHS CDO—will review, adjudicate, and propose
  changes to HHS data policies for streamlining and improvements to eliminate information silos and facilitate data sharing as a unified HHS.
*	**Improve and Reconstitute HHS Data Governance:** New data governance models will be required. HHS CXOs expect to collaborate with the White House, OMB policy experts, and
  other leadership to reimagine and reconstitute the existing HHS Data Governance Board (DGB) led by the CDO. Future HHS DGB iterations must move at today’s pace of digital
 	change, while further empowering U.S. citizens and patients to have control over their personal health information. The HHS DGB will need to pioneer novel models of data
 	governance— likely in tandem with AI governance—so that HHS can learn, grow, and evolve its data governance practices with industry, academia, and all sectors on the
 	frontlines of data use.
*	**Underpin HHS Partnerships with Transparency:** Transparent data-sharing practices enable collaboration across sectors, aligning crosscutting efforts across multiple
  sectors to solve real-world challenges. When coupled with radical transparency, public-private partnerships can increase public trust through transparency, the co-creation
 	of solutions, and the delivery of measurable impact with results faster than government alone.
*	**Catalyze American Innovation:** Open access to HHS Open Data drives scientific discovery, entrepreneurial breakthroughs, and technological advancements, positioning the
  United States as a global leader in health innovation.
*	**Fuel Emerging Technologies and AI:** By making high-quality, machine-readable data accessible, HHS empowers the development of cutting-edge technologies and AI solutions
  that enhance healthcare delivery, operational efficiency, and public health outcomes. Please let HHS know of other emerging trends, technologies, and priorities with
 	public benefit that are missing and should be featured in the Living HHS Open Data Plan.
