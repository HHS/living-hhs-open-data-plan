## Data Collection Processes for Open Formats

HHS is committed to transforming its data collection processes to meet the highest standards of accessibility, usability, and interoperability. By adopting open formats, HHS ensures its data is machine-readable, and published using open data formats ([JSON](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/), [CSV](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180), [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/), etc.)[^24], fostering transparency, operational efficiency, and innovation in alignment with the OPEN Government Data Act. To maximize the value of its data, HHS has embraced the **FAIR-D principles**—**Findable**[^25], **Accessible**[^26], **Interoperable**[^27], **Reusable**[^26], and **Delightful**[^28][^29], (FAIR-D)—establishing secure, trustworthy, and open-by-default practices. Standardizing procedures and prioritizing Open Data not only increase public access but also drive innovation, economic growth, and accountability. For example, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act[^30] mandates that the federal government ensure electronic and information technology is accessible to individuals with disabilities. These accessibility features enable people with vision impairments, who may use screen readers, to interact with digital documents and websites in ways comparable to sighted individuals. At HHS, these features are implemented to serve two key groups: (1) federal employees and (2) members of the public. By adhering to Section 508 standards and embracing technology for greatest reach, HHS ensures that its Open Data is broadly available and usable to all.

### Completed Projects

Open Data collection practices are on-going with continuous improvements (marked with asterisk*) to select HHS completed projects:  

- **Envisioned and launched HealthData.gov***[^31] 15 years ago with HHS Section 508 (Level AA[^32]) web accessibility standards, spearheading the federal Open Data movement.
  - [Open.FDA.gov](https://open.fda.gov/)*[^33],  publishes usage metrics since its launch, similar to HealthData.gov with digital analytics and metrics. This has helped FDA build awareness on the value of the public data sets to drive innovation and effectiveness of initiatives targeting adverse events, drug shortages, food/product recalls, and FDA regulatory decisions. 
- **Pioneered responsible data sharing practices***[^34] in both Open Data and Open Science, developing risk-informed approaches to weigh and balance the expected societal rewards/benefits of information disclosures with the expected societal risks/costs.
- **Delivered [U.S. Open Government](https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/us-open-government)*[^35] progress through Open Data** and data-driven innovation by listening and responding to citizens’ campaigns that catalyzed HHS action to address America’s opioid crisis, rising suicide rates, and Lyme and tick-borne diseases.
- **Enhanced Transparency and Accessibility of Federal Spending Data through the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act[^36]) of 2014*** by implementing an automated monthly process to report HHS contracts, grants, and financial assistance spending data to [USASpending.gov](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usaspending.gov%2F&data=05%7C02%7CKristen.Honey%40hhs.gov%7Ca4e2e8456abf4fa66c9c08ddbe27a3dc%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C638875799635902074%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=uyAZEHnhVIt1DIzoBJ8lCY2fjVnLLPBKkrkGDsNgA2E%3D&reserved=0)[^37]. Consistent with the DATA Act[^38], HHS is strengthening data integrity with transparency to the public regarding how federal dollars are spent.
- **Harnessed the power of Open Data to fuel American Innovation and Open innovation*** and HHS has run more innovation challenges and prizes than all other federal agencies[^39]. 
- **Unlocked information for all citizens through Open Science***, with HHS housing Science.gov[^40] and PubMed[^41] maintaining over 38 million citations for biomedical literature, PubMed Central with other 11.1 million articles available to everyone without paywalls[^42][^43], and making underlying research data available[^44]. See the Open Science Disclosure Risk Management: A Workshop Report and Corresponding Recommendations for the Federal Research Community[^45].
- **Pioneered Public Engagements, Health Datapaloozas[^46], and Tech Sprints like TOP/TOPx[^47]*** to showcase and celebrate Open Data for impact using a variety of HHS tech sprints, innovation sprints, hackathons, “Healthathons,” Datapaloozas, and other public-facing engagements with events fueled by [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/), the home of HHS Open Data.
- **Published a [HHS Metadata Standard](https://healthdata.gov/HHS/HHS-Metadata-Standard/9g3v-hy22) on HealthData.gov***—as part of July 2025 enhancements—with a call-to-action for public feedback to help HHS improve this version 1.0 standard with future iterations.
- **Published the [HHS Data Inventory](https://healthdata.gov/HHS/HHS-Data-Inventory/kaw8-4tez) on HealthData.gov***—as part of July 2025 enhancements—with a call-to-action for public feedback to help improve this version 1.0, as HHS builds a comprehensive metadata inventory to improve the findability and usability of its public and non-public data assets in machine-readable, open formats from all HHS Divisions.
- **Published the [Living HHS Open Data Plan](https://healthdata.gov/HHS/HHS-Open-Data-Plan/m9xc-txya)***— accompanying the [Living HHS Open Data Plan on HHS GitHub](https://github.com/HHS/living-hhs-open-data-plan)[^48] for two-way, open, public suggestions for continuous improvements.

### HHS 2025 Initiatives and Next Steps

Building upon past achievements, the HHS CDO and data leaders across the Department expect to implement a series of Open Data initiatives in 2025 and beyond:  

- **Eliminate Information Silos**: In collaboration with the HHS CTO, CAIO, CIO, and leadership from all HHS Divisions, the CDO is responsibly unlocking HHS Open Data to facilitate interagency and intra-agency information sharing and fostering a “sharing by default” culture across the entire department to the extent permitted by law. Open Data must enable collaboration, improve efficiency, and enhance transparency to achieve U.S. goals outlined in Executive Order 14243: Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse[^49][^50], OMB guidance, and HHS Secretary priorities including Make America Healthy Again (MAHA)[^51][^52][^53]. Data tagging and quality metadata for findability—for example, improving the metadata and comprehensiveness of the HHS Data Inventory, published July 2025 with version 1.0—are foundational for efficient exchanges of information. As HHS becomes a more unified Department, all HHS Divisions must strive for machine-readable, standardized data documentation to easily understand and assess the suitability of data for a clear purpose.  
- **Unlock Real-World Data for Impact**: The CDO will focus resources on HHS and MAHA priorities, including lifecycle data management and sharing HHS Open Data for public health priorities like the chronic disease crisis.  
- **Publish a Comprehensive [HHS Data Inventory](https://healthdata.gov/HHS/HHS-Data-Inventory/kaw8-4tez) (metadata catalog) with DCAT-U.S. 3.0**: The CDO and data leaders will continue to build open Application Programming Interface (APIs) and machine-readable resources for the public to use the comprehensive HHS Data Inventory with DCAT-U.S. 3.0 standards. The HHS Data Inventory includes public and non-public data assets from all HHS Divisions, as shared by the data stewards, giving the Department’s most comprehensive view of metadata describing HHS data across Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions. Building upon version 1.0 released in July 2025, the HHS Data Inventory gives employees and the public access to a single enterprise inventory to make certain HHS data discoverable, sharable, (re)useable, and transformed into understanding in order to guide decisions and actions.  
- **Review, Streamline, and Improve HHS Data Policy**: The HHS CDO—in collaboration with the HHS CTO, CAIO, CIO, privacy officers, financial managers, interagency Councils, and leadership from all HHS Divisions—will review, adjudicate, and propose changes to HHS data policies for streamlining and improvements to eliminate information silos and facilitate appropriate data sharing as a unified HHS.
- **Improve and Reconstitute HHS Data Governance**: New data governance models will be required. The HHS CDO expect to collaborate with the Federal CDO Council and HHS leadership to reimagine and reconstitute the existing HHS Data Governance Board (DGB) with public-facing, open meetings that engage industry, academia, and all sectors using HHS Open Data in their organizations. Successful data governance involves feedback loops, which the HHS DGB structure lacks today, for data stewards and users to be tightly coupled through bidirectional information exchanges.

>_Propose ideas or examples for piloting innovative data governance models with patients, industry, academia, and other sectors to improve health data governance and transparency._

Future HHS DGB iterations will benefit from increased transparency (e.g., public meetings), modernized technology (e.g., all HHS Divisions connected to file share), and expanded engagement with external experts (e.g., Special Government Employees [SGEs]). This will necessitate coordination with the Federal CDC Council and across HHS, including working with HHS legal and ethics officials, Counsel, HHS data stewards, and HHS offices with equities in the Evidence Act, SHARE IT Act, Information Quality Act, Sunshine Laws, the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), and other laws that influence DGB options for engaging the public and SGEs. It will also necessitate novel approaches, as described in Appendix B - Novel Models of Data Governance: Inspired by Tribal Data Governance for Radical, Collective, Self-Governance.  

In addition, today’s HHS DGB must pivot focus from government process to delivery outcomes with measurable metrics of success, while accelerating its cadence to move at today’s pace of digital change. Given limited time and resources, the HHS DGB expects to scout, lift, and co-design novel pilots of data governance with other sectors—not reinvent wheels that likely exist in other sectors—to give U.S. citizens greater agency with opt in/out controls over their own health data. Ambitious DGB changes may occur in tandem with HHS AI governance, since data and AI are inextricably linked on the frontlines of data use.  

- **Underpin HHS Partnerships with Transparency**: Transparent data-sharing practices enable collaboration across sectors, aligning crosscutting efforts across multiple sectors to solve real-world challenges. When coupled with radical transparency, public-private partnerships can increase public trust through transparency, the co-creation of solutions, and the delivery of measurable impact with results faster than government alone. For more details, see Appendix C - HHS Partnerships with Transparency.  
- **Catalyze American Innovation**: Open access to HHS Open Data contributes to scientific discovery, entrepreneurial breakthroughs, and technological advancements, positioning the United States as a global leader in health innovation.  
- **Fuel Emerging Technologies and AI**: By making high-quality, machine-readable data accessible, HHS empowers the development of cutting-edge technologies and AI solutions that enhance healthcare delivery, operational efficiency, and public health outcomes. Please let HHS know of other emerging trends, technologies, and priorities with public benefit that are missing and should be featured in the Living HHS Open Data Plan.
