## Message from the HHS Chief Data Officer—People First, Data Always!

Fifteen years ago, HHS led the federal Open Data movement and launched HealthData.gov, the home of HHS Open Data. With the publication of this Open Data Plan and 
a refreshed HealthData.gov launched in July 2025, HHS has refocused its efforts on open data and delivered on three milestones.
1. HHS Open Data Plan (this document)
2. HHS Metadata Standard (version 1.0)
3. HHS Data Inventory (version 1.0 metadata catalog of public and non-public data assets).

American taxpayers fund HHS data and information, making it essential that these resources are democratized—easily discoverable, machine-readable, and freely accessible 
to all. All Americans have a right to the information that underpins the Department’s operations, federally funded research, and broader “open” initiatives including 
partnerships, citizen science, crowdsourcing, prizes, and innovation challenges fueled by HHS Open Data. With the maturation of multiple open communities, HHS is poised 
in 2025 to link synergistic ecosystems for increased impact. 
- Open Data: [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) and [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/)
- Open Government: [Open.USA.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/us-open-government)
- Open Innovation: [Challenge.gov](https://challenge.gov/)
- Open Science: [Science.gov](https://www.science.gov/)
- Open Source Code: [Code.gov](https://code.gov/) and [HHS GitHub repo](https://github.com/HHS)

HHS will improve its ability to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decisions across all levels of the Department. To support this, the HHS Chief Data 
Officer (CDO) collaborated with data leaders to define shared values for navigating future challenges and change. While the HHS workforce, interagency partners, and 
external collaborators may differ on data priorities or interpretations, we can all unite around values that drive progress and collaboration with a “sharing by default” 
culture and “open by default” data ethos.

Core values underpin the HHS Open Data community, underlying every aspect of this plan.
**1.    TRANSPARENCY:** Radical openness by default.
**2.    PURPOSE:** Data that serves the public good.
**3.    RELENTLESS OPTIMIZATION:** Adapt, refine, and improve using agile methods, two-way feedback, a growth mindset, and accountability.\
**4.    EXCELLENCE:** Real-world evidence drives impact.
**5.    RESPECT:** People and patients as equal partners.
**6.    INTEGRITY:** Find the truth. Tell the truth.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the HHS Open Data ecosystem—a community of solvers, collaboratively co-creating a more transparent, accountable, and responsive HHS. Today, we have incredible opportunity to responsibly share data, eliminate silos, modernize government, and drive progress through partnerships and emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). All are welcome—join us! People first, data always!

HHS is trusted with personal data by all Americans, patients, and clinicians alike. HHS must honor that trust, by keeping data private, while delivering value and 
rewarding individuals for investing their data and digital stories with us. The HHS Open Data approach ensures that the healthcare system is fully informed with HHS data, 
ensuring that patients benefit from downstream data marketplace and ecosystems, while balancing the need to minimize unnecessary risks to the individual, including privacy 
harms and confidentiality, embracing our responsibilities.  

Change will move at the speed of trust. Trust may be defined as “consistency over time” and this Living Plan acknowledges that HHS can do more to build trust in the 
ecosystem. Rebuilding and strengthening the public’s trust in HHS data is paramount for HHS Open Data success, and change is here. In 2025, HHS recommits to reliably 
sharing high-quality data, consistently engaging with radical transparency, adopting “open” methods (e.g., [Open Science](https://www.science.gov/), 
[Open Innovation](https://challenge.gov/), [Open Source Code](https://github.com/HHS)), and openly 
communicating with opportunities for two-way public engagements, events, and public-private partnerships.  

### Open Methods to Improve the Living HHS Open Data Plan  

This Living Plan satisfies Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements for the Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (Evidence Act) of 2018 Title II—also known as the 
Open, Public, Electronic, and Necessary (OPEN) Data Government Act—but its purpose transcends mere box-checking. When Open Data is reduced to a compliance task, 
organizations lose the transformative spirit of transparency and collaboration. Impactful Open Data requires a cultural shift at every level of an organization, embracing 
a mindset of “share by default” and “open by default” to democratize access to information as a public good. By distributing power to the people, the future of HHS Open 
Data aims to empower Americans with timely, machine-readable, high-quality, freely available data from all HHS Divisions, while lifting new data governance models to give 
U.S. citizens and patients more agency and control over their own data.  

This Living HHS Open Data Plan is designed to evolve with public input and feedback. It is modular, so each chapter is its own independent GitHub file for the public to 
submit issues and ideas, in response to a general HHS request for public input and comments. The HHS GitHub “Tell Us About Your Experience with the HHS Open Data Plan” is 
an online form with open-ended space for public response. With this agile approach, HHS aims to avoid the pitfalls of bureaucratic compliance while maintaining focus on 
the ultimate goal: fostering collaboration and unlocking the transformative power of data for operational efficiency, scientific discovery, innovation, and public impact.  

The value of HHS Open Data is far reaching:  
- __Eliminate silos to improve operational efficiencies:__ Streamline data-sharing processes across divisions to reduce redundancies and enhance program effectiveness.  
-   __Drive new business models:__ Enable public-private partnerships that leverage HHS data to create innovative solutions for healthcare and human services.  
-   __Fuel American innovation:__ Provide researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers with access to high-value datasets that catalyze advancements in science, technology,
and public health.  
-   __Accelerate scientific breakthroughs:__ Facilitate the use of real-world data to inform evidence-based research and policy decisions.  
-   __Demystify government with transparency:__ Embrace open methods, work in the open, and pull back the curtain on who, what, where, when, why, and how HHS operates.  
-   __Maximize taxpayers’ ROI on HHS data investments:__ Ensure that every dollar spent on data collection and management delivers measurable benefits to the American people.  

### Everyday Leadership: Driving Open Data Transformation  

Achieving the goals of the Living Plan requires sustained effort and action across all levels of the HHS workforce. Leadership, managers, data stewards, and staff must 
integrate data into everyday decision-making. We must all foster a culture where data-guided insights drive understanding and impact. HHS Open Data transformation begins 
with everyday leadership, where every Federal employee can commit to lead by example and work in the open with transparency to expand trust in the agency, in science, and 
in the data stewarded by HHS. We can all say “yes” by default to responsible data sharing requests, so that historical gatekeeping norms and gatekeeping culture across HHS 
will be transformed into a data-driven, enabling culture without silos.  

### Everyone Included: Valuing All Perspectives  

The success of the Living Plan depends on a collective effort across the entire HHS workforce—data stewards, scientists, strategists, communicators, administrators, problem 
solvers, and innovators—with everyone recommitting to transparency, HHS data, and following the data, wherever the data and science lead. Moreover, HHS must be responsive to 
the American public’s needs, requests, and suggestions for improving the Living Plan, [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/) resources, and Departmental initiatives.  

Across all HHS bureaucracy levels in day-to-day work, employees are encouraged to enable a “yes” by default data-sharing culture with transparency to eliminate information 
silos, while actively answering. All HHS staff can aid this transformation by asking themselves the following three questions.  

__1. How can I responsibly publish more “open by default” data on [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/)?__  
Remember, the public has a legal right to federal data when expected societal benefits/rewards outweigh expected costs/risks (e.g., balancing accessibility and security 
while ensuring quality, ethical use, and protection of priority data assets).

__2. How can I more transparently engage, listen, and respond to citizens and public feedback?__  
Remember, the Evidence Act mandates “open by default” data and HHS policy advances open science (free public access without paywalls), and successful delivery involves 
two-way public engagements with responsiveness to citizens. 

__3. How do I ensure, measure, and track real-world impact from my HHS data work?__  
Responsible data sharing with a “yes” enabling culture is a good step and necessary—yet insufficient—to transform raw data into understanding and insights to guide decisions 
and actions. All data projects should explicitly define measurable metrics of success that matter to the American people. As civil servants working on HHS data projects, we 
must hold ourselves accountable to these measurable metrics of success that will vary by project, so that HHS data efforts will directly improve service delivery with 
positive outcomes to U.S. health and human lives.  

Lastly, HHS Open Data is not just about numbers; it is about the people with the human dimensions. With a holistic view of data science, HHS must prioritize the lifting of 
people and sharing data-driven stories. “[Stories are data with a soul](https://healthdata.gov/),” to paraphrase Brené Brown, and the 2025 HealthData.gov refresh features stories to connect our HHS 
data with collective purpose.  

By addressing the above questions and embracing a culture of transparency, collaboration, and accountability, HHS commits to unlocking the full potential of its data to 
enhance the health and well-being of all Americans. Join us!  
## Unified HHS for Data Sharing  

HHS must come together as one department for successful data lifecycle management that responsibly unlocks HHS Open Data for the public. The nation’s health and human 
services needs are complex—and public health problems are rarely solved by a single federal initiative. Although data is a critical strategic asset for advancing public 
health, data sharing and interoperability are critical to making people healthier.  

As such, HHS embraces the opportunity to transform itself into an agile Department, responsive to the nation’s needs, by leveraging the power of the information available 
across its multi-agency data assets. Contributors to this Living Plan included HHS staff from:  

1. __Office of the Secretary and Administration for a Healthy America__ (AHA) including:  
   a)   __Immediate Office of the Secretary__ (IOS)  
   b)   __Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration__ (ASA)  
   c)   __Office of the Assistant Secretary for Financial Resources__ (ASFR)  
   d)   __Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health__ (OASH)  
   e)   __Office of the Assistant Secretary for Legislation__ (ASL)  
   f)   __Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation__ (ASPE)  
   g)   __Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response__ (ASPR)  
   h)   __Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs__ (ASPA)  
   i)   __Office for Civil Rights__ (OCR)  
   j)   __Office of the General Counsel__ (OGC)  
   k)   __Office of Global Affairs__ (OGA)  
   l)   __Office of Inspector General__ (OIG)  
   m)   __Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs__ (IEA)  
   n)   __Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology__ (ONC), also known as the __Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy__ (OSTP)  
2.  __Administration for Children and Families__ (ACF)
3.  __Administration for Community Living__ (ACL)
4.  __Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality__ (AHRQ)
5.  __Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health__ (ARPA-H)
6.  __Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response__ (ASPR)
7.  __Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry__ (ATSDR)
8.  __Centers for Disease Control and Prevention__ (CDC)
9.  __Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services__ (CMS)
10. __Food and Drug Administration__ (FDA)
11. __Health Resources and Services Administration__ (HRSA)
12. __Indian Health Service__ (IHS)
13. __National Institutes of Health__ (NIH)
14. __Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration__ (SAMHSA)

The Living Plan will be updated in alignment with new office structures, as new information becomes known about HHS reorganizations.
## Data Collection Processes for Open Formats

HHS is committed to transforming its data collection processes to meet the highest standards of accessibility, usability, and interoperability. By adopting open formats, 
HHS ensures its data is machine-readable, fostering transparency, operational efficiency, and innovation in alignment with the OPEN Government Data Act. To maximize the 
value of its data, HHS has embraced the **FAIR-D principles—Findable[^2], Accessible[^3], Interoperable[^4], Reusable[^4], and Delightful[^5][^6], (FAIR-D)**—establishing 
secure, trustworthy, and open-by-default practices. Standardizing procedures and prioritizing Open Data not only increases public access but also drives innovation, economic 
growth, and accountability. This commitment strengthens government operations, builds public trust, and advances HHS’s mission to improve the health and well-being of all 
Americans.

### Completed Projects

Open Data collection practices are on-going with continuous improvements (marked with asterisk*) to select HHS completed projects:

- **Envisioned and launched HealthData.gov[^7]*** 15 years ago, spearheading the federal Open Data movement prior to Data.gov, as the home of government Open Data.
  - **Open.FDA.gov[^8]**, publishes usage metrics since its launch, similar to HealthData.gov with digital analytics and metrics. This has helped FDA build awareness on
      the value of the public data sets to drive innovation and effectiveness of initiatives targeting adverse events, drug shortages, food/product recalls, and FDA
      regulatory decisions.
- **Pioneered responsible data sharing practices[^9]*** in both Open Data and Open Science, developing risk-informed approaches to weigh and balance the expected societal
  rewards/benefits of information disclosures with the expected societal risks/costs.
- **Delivered U.S. Open Government[^10]** progress through Open Data and data-driven innovation by listening and responding to citizens’ campaigns that catalyzed HHS action
  to address America’s opioid crisis, suicide prevention, and Lyme and tick-borne diseases.
- **Enhanced Transparency and Accessibility of Federal Spending Data through the DATA Act** by implementing an automated monthly process to report contracts, grants, and
  financial assistance spending data to [USASpending.gov](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usaspending.gov%2F&data=05%7C02%7CKristen.Honey%40hhs.gov%7Ca4e2e8456abf4fa66c9c08ddbe27a3dc%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C638875799635902074%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=uyAZEHnhVIt1DIzoBJ8lCY2fjVnLLPBKkrkGDsNgA2E%3D&reserved=0)[^11]
 	consistent with the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act)[^12] strengthening data integrity and resulting in transparency to the public regarding how
 	federal dollars are spent.
- **Harnessed the power of Open Data to fuel American Innovation and Open innovation*** and HHS has run more innovation challenges and prizes than all other federal
  agencies[^13]. 
- **Unlocked information for all citizens through Open Science***, with HHS housing Science.gov[^14] and PubMed[^15] with over 38 million citations for biomedical literature
  with underlying data available to everyone without paywalls[^16]. See the Open Science Disclosure Risk Management: A Workshop Report and Corresponding Recommendations for
 	the	Federal Research Community[^17] in Appendix B (Open Science Disclosure Risk Management (2019 NSTC SOS)).
- **Pioneered Public Engagements, Health Datapaloozas[^18], and Tech Sprints like TOP/TOPx[^19]*** to showcase and celebrate Open Data for impact using a variety of HHS tech
  sprints, innovation sprints, hackathons, “Healthathons,” Datapaloozas, and other public-facing engagements with events fueled by [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/),
 	the home of HHS Open Data.
- **Published a HHS Metadata Standard***—accompanying this Living Plan in July 2025—with a public call-to-action for feedback to improve the standard with future iterations.
- **Published the HHS Data Inventory***—accompanying this Living Plan in July 2025—with a public call-to-action to establish a comprehensive metadata inventory of public and
  non-public data assts managed by HHS in machine-readable, open formats.
- **Published the Living HHS Open Data Plan***—this document with accompanying [GitHub Living HHS Open Data Plan](https://github.com/HHS/hhs-open-data-plan) for two-way,
  open, public suggestions for continuous improvements. Please let HHS know of other completed projects with public benefit that are missing and should be featured in the
 	Living HHS Open Data Plan.

### HHS 2025 Initiatives and Next Steps

Building upon past achievements, the HHS CDO and data leaders across the Department expect to implement a series of Open Data initiatives in 2025 and beyond:  

*	**Eliminate Information Silos:** In collaboration with HHS leadership, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and the Chief AI Officer (CAIO), the HHS CDO is harnessing the power
  of HHS Open Data to dismantle barriers to interagency and intra-agency data sharing, creating a “sharing by default” culture across the entire department. Open Data must
 	enable collaboration, improve efficiency, and enhance transparency to achieve U.S. goals outlined in Executive Order 14243: Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse[^20][^21],
 	OMB guidance, and HHS Secretary priorities including Make America Health Again (MAHA)[^22][^23][^24], Open Data.
*	**Unlock Real-World Data for Impact:** The CDO will focus resources on MAHA priorities, including lifecycle data management and sharing HHS Open Data for public health
  priorities like the chronic disease crisis. 
*	**Publish a Comprehensive HHS Data Inventory with DCAT-U.S. 3.0:** The CDO and data leaders will continue to build open APIs and machine-readable resources for the public
  to use the comprehensive HHS Data Inventory, using DCAT-U.S. 3.0 standards. The HHS Data Inventory includes public and non-public data assets from all Operating Divisions
 	and Staff Divisions, giving HHS employees and the public access to a single enterprise inventory in one place for the whole Department to make HHS data discoverable,
 	sharable, (re)useable, and transformed into understanding to guide decisions and actions. 
*	**Review, Streamline, and Improve HHS Data Policy:** In collaboration with HHS leadership, the CXOs—HHS CTO, HHS CAIO, and HHS CDO—will review, adjudicate, and propose
  changes to HHS data policies for streamlining and improvements to eliminate information silos and facilitate data sharing as a unified HHS.
*	**Improve and Reconstitute HHS Data Governance:** New data governance models will be required. HHS CXOs expect to collaborate with the White House, OMB policy experts, and
  other leadership to reimagine and reconstitute the existing HHS Data Governance Board (DGB) led by the CDO. Future HHS DGB iterations must move at today’s pace of digital
 	change, while further empowering U.S. citizens and patients to have control over their personal health information. The HHS DGB will need to pioneer novel models of data
 	governance— likely in tandem with AI governance—so that HHS can learn, grow, and evolve its data governance practices with industry, academia, and all sectors on the
 	frontlines of data use.
*	**Underpin HHS Partnerships with Transparency:** Transparent data-sharing practices enable collaboration across sectors, aligning crosscutting efforts across multiple
  sectors to solve real-world challenges. When coupled with radical transparency, public-private partnerships can increase public trust through transparency, the co-creation
 	of solutions, and the delivery of measurable impact with results faster than government alone.
*	**Catalyze American Innovation:** Open access to HHS Open Data drives scientific discovery, entrepreneurial breakthroughs, and technological advancements, positioning the
  United States as a global leader in health innovation.
*	**Fuel Emerging Technologies and AI:** By making high-quality, machine-readable data accessible, HHS empowers the development of cutting-edge technologies and AI solutions
  that enhance healthcare delivery, operational efficiency, and public health outcomes. Please let HHS know of other emerging trends, technologies, and priorities with
 	public benefit that are missing and should be featured in the Living HHS Open Data Plan.

## Data Usage Information

HHS data usage statistics are available at [https://healthdata.gov/metrics](https://healthdata.gov/metrics). The top 1,000 data assets are dynamically displayed and easily 
discoverable on the HHS Open Data Resources page at [URL link]. HHS is also part of the U.S. General Services Administration 
[Digital Analytics Program (DAP)](https://digital.gov/guides/dap)[^26] that enables federal agencies to understand how the public finds, accesses, and uses government 
services online.  

Data usage information is anonymous, as it includes only summary statistics. This reflects HHS’s unwavering commitment to protect individual privacy and ensure compliance 
with the Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other federal regulations.  

__Protecting Privacy and Ensuring Compliance:__ In data usage tracking efforts, HHS maintains an unwavering commitment to protecting individual privacy and ensuring 
compliance with HIPAA and all federal regulations. Data usage information is collected, de-identified for protection of individual privacy, and analyzed in aggregate form, 
with stringent measures in place to prevent the identification of individual users or the compromise of sensitive information.

__Tracking and Analytics to Inform Decision Making:__ Insights gleaned from HHS data usage information inform HHS policy-making and resource allocation. By understanding 
which websites and datasets are most frequently accessed and how they are being used, HHS can better align Open Data efforts with public needs and scientific research 
priorities.

__Transparency and Reporting:__ HHS regularly publishes reports on data usage statistics and trends[^27][^28][^29]. These reports provide valuable insights to both internal 
stakeholders and the public, fostering a culture of openness and accountability in our data management practices.

__Collaborations and Partnerships for Enhanced Insights:__ To extract additional understanding and value from HHS data usage information, HHS engages in strategic 
collaborations through the CDO Council, other federal agencies, and public-private partnerships. Such collaborations enable a more sophisticated analysis of data usage 
trends, many of which are available on Data.gov[^30] and the interagency Digital Analytics Program (DAP)[^31].

HHS communicates the usage and value of its data at public-facing engagements and events including technology sprints, innovation sprints, demo days, and other opportunities 
that showcase data usage information. HHS features select data usage information through the HealthData.gov/stories , also known as the HealthData.gov blog.  

Data usage information must guide the HHS Open Data strategy, illuminating the path to maximum efficiency, economic growth, scientific discovery, and public impact. By 
tracking and analyzing how HHS data is accessed and utilized, we transform raw statistics into actionable insights. See Appendix C – HHS Open Data Action Items with 
Timeline, for the Living HHS Open Data action plan with 2025 – 2028 timeline.
## Prioritizing Public Data Asset Review

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is committed to fostering innovation, transparency, and collaboration through our data-sharing initiatives. A critical 
component of an HHS Open Data Strategy will be to identify and publish priority public datasets, focusing on high-impact, transformative data resources.  

Criteria for prioritizing datasets may include:  

1. __Artificial Intelligence and Innovation:__ Datasets used to develop, test, or measure the performance of artificial intelligence systems, driving cutting-edge
   advancements in healthcare and human services.

2. __Public Impact and Mission Alignment:__ Information with significant potential to impact public health, further the core mission of HHS agencies, or meet critical needs
   of the Federal Government.

3. __Efficient Service and Benefit Delivery:__ Datasets supporting the delivery of essential services or benefits to the public, including information sharing to streamline,
   simplify, and improve HHS processes to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our programs.

4. __Scientific and Technological Progress:__ Data with high potential to spur innovation, accelerate science, or drive technological advancements in health and human
   services.

5. __High-Demand and Timely Topics:__ Datasets related to pressing public health issues may be subject to frequent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and are made
   visible to the public in the HHS FOIA Reading Room[^32]. This FOIA demand signal demonstrates high public interest or usage, and the HHS CDO evaluating how to use FOIA
   requests to help prioritize HHS Open Data workflows and department-wide processes.

[^32]: https://www.hhs.gov/foia/electronic-reading-room/

We believe these focused criteria will ensure our data resources provide maximum value to our partners in the private sector, public institutions, and non-profit 
organizations. By prioritizing these high-impact datasets, we aim to facilitate groundbreaking research, inform critical policy decisions, and drive innovations that can 
transform healthcare and human services.  

We encourage all our partners to engage with these datasets and provide feedback on their utility and impact. Together, we can leverage the power of data to address critical 
health challenges, enhance service delivery, and improve the well-being of all Americans.  

See Appendix C - HHS Open Data Action Items with Timeline, for the Living HHS Open Data action plan with 2025 – 2028 timeline.  
## Improving Processes for Meeting Open Data Goals

Data is central to the HHS mission, which includes regulating food, drugs, medical products, and much more. Per the requirements of the OPEN Government Data Act[^33], 
the HHS CDO will update this section of the Living HHS Open Data Plan following the Department’s reorganization.

## Intra-HHS Data Sharing — Be the Change

HHS data-driven delivery relies on its ability to securely and ethically share information across all its HHS Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions for the collaborative 
solving of pressing public health needs. To this end, HHS views its data is an enterprise resource, and not a series of collections scattered across government silos.  

The HHS CTO and Chief Information Officer (CIO) are leading information technology (IT) enterprise-wide integration and modernization, working closely with the CDO to create 
one umbrella as a unified Department with shared, enterprise-wide capabilities to:  

*   __Eliminate silos to improve operational efficiencies:__ Publishing its data assets in a centralized, secure data catalog in Healthdata.gov. Ensuring the data is
  machine-readable to the extent possible and Linking data through secure, cloud-based lake house interchanges 
*   __Accelerate scientific breakthroughs:__ Unlocking the use of real-world data products and services to leads departments and agencies to develop new insights and enables
  Departments and HHS to make more informed evidence-based decisions. By bringing together program leads with shared goals and develop appropriate, cross-cutting to
    strategically advance the Department’s most pressing public health priorities and solve the most critical operational needs as a result it will stream data related
    procurements. 
*   __Demystify government with transparency:__ Strategically close interoperability gaps through cross-agency collaboration and establishment of common data terms and
  definitions and single “sources of truth”. Promote data literacy across Department staff. 
*   __Drive new business models:__ Enhances the Health Data marketplace features, by streamlining data procurements and third-party purchases. Eliminated need for conducting
  data calls, data use agreements by sharing data products and services built by various departments to address HHS’s mission. Finding unified enterprise data management
    solutions and avoid the unnecessary use of countless non-communicating data platforms and analytic tools 
*   __Fuel American innovation:__ Catalyzes the advancement in the specialized data products and services with access to high-value datasets developed by various departments.
  Such as optimize automation and ethical use of artificial intelligence tools to showcase specialized data services to eliminate redundant and duplicate activities around
    data cleanup, validation and data transformation. 
*   __Maximize taxpayers’ ROI on HHS data investments:__ Ensure that every dollar spent on data collection and management delivers measurable benefits to the American people.
  HHS Divisions shall use opportunities to collaborate and coordinate their data-driven public health activities through bringing together agency data leaders in venues such
    as the HHS Data Governance Board and HHS Data Council. Within these venues, agency data leaders will identify critical gaps and develop and implement plans to efficiently
    and effectively resolve them – ultimately to ensure the proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars and optimal service to the public.  
## Real-World Data for Impact

The entire “spirit” of the [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174), for which the OPEN 
Government Data Act is Title II, is to ask and answer questions (build evidence) to support policymaking—meaning that federal agencies should collect, use, and acquire data 
to apply it in ways for the betterment of the nation. This includes rigorous application of the scientific method to test scientific hypotheses, while following the data 
wherever the data lead. HHS, like all of Federal government, should always use data to maximize the impact of science, programs, and services for the common good.  

Real-world data (RWD[^34]), sometimes called real-world evidence (RWE[^35]), align with HHS Open Data values and goals to drive healthcare innovation, transparency, and 
improved outcomes. HHS promotes open access to and interoperability of RWD, including HIPAA-compliant information from electronic health records, insurance claims, and 
patient registries.

[^34]: https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/nih-cms-partner-to-research-root-causes-of-autism.html

> Real-World Data provides a foundation for a “Learning Health System” that can rapidly adapt to changing circumstances, emergent diseases, and enable learning from the
treatment of patients to inform others with the same condition.  

This real-world approach enables diverse stakeholders, such as regulators and payers, to gain insights from routine clinical care—the real-world and provides a foundation 
for a “Learning Health System” that can rapidly adapt to changing circumstances, emergent diseases, and enable learning from the treatment of patients to inform others with 
the same condition. By adopting “open by default”, while safeguarding individual privacy, HHS aims to leverage high-quality RWD/RWE, clinical evidence regarding the usage, 
and potential benefits or risks, of a medical product derived from analysis of RWD/RWE. Such interdisciplinary analyses and results will inform regulatory decisions, 
evaluate treatments, and accelerate effective care delivery, supporting evidence-based policymaking and patient-centered healthcare.  

At the core of the Living HHS Open Data Plan for RWD lies the concept that data is a “public utility” for good that powers scientific advancement, innovation, and progress. 
Public utilities exist because the community has recognized that the service or product, they provide is essential to the life and health of Americans. In today’s world, the 
public needs access to healthcare and public health data, which allows individuals to take control of their own health and allows aggregate, anonymized, deidentified data to 
be leveraged for innovation.  

HHS supports public and private partnerships for data utility models that increases data access for public consumers, including patients, providers, payers, state agencies, 
and researchers. The health utility concept is emerging today based on lessons learned from early gains by Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), and by expanding the role of 
HIEs into a public utility or Health Data Utilities (HDUs). HIEs have provided critical and timely patient data to aid in treatment across health care providers, but new 
governance models will be necessary to empower patients and ensure HHS transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to citizen prioritizes and real-world needs.  

The on-going HIEs evolution into HDUs is opportunity for the HHS CDO and partners to pilot novel data governance methods and pioneer new approaches to interoperability. This 
progress with HIEs is informative and important, yet alone it is not sufficient to enable a nationwide learning health system. The CDO expects to pilot novel data governance 
models with industry, academia, non-profit organizations, and all sectors—including individuals with lived experiences, like patients and caregivers, as partners—to co-create
new modes of data governance in collaboration with HHS.  

In a learning health system, cancer treatment becomes more precise and effective as clinicians can find other patients with similar tumor characteristics, especially 
genomically similar tumors, and enable clinicians to learn what treatments are or are not effective enabling better and more tailored treatment with the right interventions, 
earlier in the course of the disease. Similar use cases for the health public utility exist for rare disease treatment; with sufficient data, the health public utility can 
support much more rapid diagnosis and treatment. Beyond the learning health system, such a public utility for health data provides the foundation for improved 
bio-surveillance, detection and analysis of adverse events from drugs, devices and biologics, as well as for research. In some respects, more importantly, such a public 
utility supports radical transparency for patients, both in terms of expanding comprehensive access to their medical history and for the ability of the public to understand 
how their data is being used, by whom and to understand the benefits from that use of their data.  

A public utility model for good and radical transparency relies on a Patient Trust Model. This model refers to the relationship between patients and their healthcare 
organizations regarding their health information. By providing patients control over their information and data and allowing for permissioning of their data through a 
health data utility creates the necessary components for a learning health system. Key elements of the Patient Trust Model includes data security and privacy, transparency 
and engagement, patient empowerment, and return of results to improve healthcare, which is a goal for a learning health system. In some ways this concept is similar to the 
Brazil's patient data model that is governed by the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD)[^36]. The LGPD grants patients access control over their data including data sharing 
and transparency on data use.  

[^36]: Brazil General Data Protection Law (LGPD), Law No. 13.709/2018 https://iapp.org/resources/article/brazilian-data-protection-law-lgpd-english-translation/

The health data utility model can also work to empower patients to take control of their own data, share it selectively with their clinical care team, and if willing, to opt 
in to specific research studies.  

*   __Standards:__ HHS supports divisions to develop specific RWD standards, for example to meet a regulatory requirement. RWD should meet the three accepted metadata
  standards currently handled by Data.gov. Standards are also needed to facilitate the interoperability of data required to integrate disparate data sources, for example,
    it is likely that the emerging market pattern of HIEs becoming state based HPUs, will continue necessitating a federated approach to a national HPU resource.

*   __Fit for purpose:__ Agencies must ensure they have clear policies for evaluating and communicating the fitness-for-purpose, or sometimes called “fit for use”, of RWD made
  available to the public. Agencies should supply adequate documentation for each released RWD to help users assess whether the data is suitable for their intended use.
    Practices may include creating a standard template or framework that offers users the necessary context and details and creation of mechanisms for transparent use of data
    and patient consent perhaps using an immutable ledger such as Blockchain.

*   __Terms of Use:__ RWD in the HHS ecosystem is open by default and should align with the privacy policy, data policy, and accessibility terms at Data.gov. When acquiring
  data, agencies should reduce the use of bespoke and custom terms in data use agreements, which would restrict ability to release data as Open Data. Agencies should
    consider multiple approaches to acquisitions and collection of data, including incorporating data agreements in the contracting or grant terms, and not in separate
    agreements. This can multiply the impact of federal funding, by ensuring that federal funding results in data available as a common good.

### Completed RWD Projects Advancing HHS Open Data

*   FDA has a long history of using RWD and RWE to monitor and evaluate the post-market safety of authorized medical products. Advances in the availability and analysis of
  RWD have increased the potential for generating robust RWE to support regulatory decisions. 

*   Completed FDA initiatives recently focused on advancing the use of RWD and RWE in regulatory decision-making and on informing healthcare policy. FDA finalized guidance
  documents on use of RWE (including electronic health records (EHRs), medical claims data and registries) to support regulatory decisions for biologics, devices, and drugs.
    Recent FDA initiatives also cover study design considerations, and procedural and regulatory requirements.

*   CMS released an updated guidance document in 2024 that describes coverage with evidence development (CED).

*   CDC Data Channels exemplify open data principles by integrating diverse data sources into user-friendly visualizations and plain language interpretations. These channels
  empower the public with clear insights into issues related to infectious diseases, like [respiratory illnesses](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html),
    as well as other important health topics, such as [mental health](https://www.cdc.gov/mental-health/about-data/index.html).

* CDC’s Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology has a dedicated team of data journalists, designers, and data experts that collaborate with CDC programs
  and emergency responses to design these channels, ensuring creation of audience-specific material and timely updates. Underlying data sources are made available at
  [data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/), enhancing transparency and enabling data reuse. 

*   CDC makes multiple other online data tools available to users. This includes [CDC WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) where users can create custom queries of vital records
  and other key public health data, providing them with up-to-date detailed information on health outcomes such as causes of death. By tailoring content and access points
    for various audiences, CDC enhances communication on urgent public health threats and accessibility to data to foster engagement and trust with the public.

### Ongoing RWD Initiatives Advancing HHS Open Data

*   The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) is conducting market research for potential procurements for real world health care data and related services.

*   With participation from multiple HHS divisions, the National Academy of Medicine has ongoing studies and convenings relating to the Learning Health System and Public
  Utility model and plan to issues reports and recommendations in the next year.

*   The NIH is planning for the development of a RWD research platform to support research generally (e.g., National Clinical Cohort Collaborative [N3C]) with initial focus
  on the causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). N3C infrastructure will also benefit other data-driven priorities like understanding nutrition for health, chronic
    diseases, environmental toxin exposures, and the benefits of healthy lifestyles.

*   NIH/NCATS Open Data Portal was created to share and visualize data in real time to accelerate discover and guide the exploration of new therapeutic hypotheses. Open Data
  Portal is built to quickly pivot and share data for emerging public health needs and is expanding to include data for other diseases.

*   FDA is committed to realizing the full potential of fit-for-purpose RWD to generate RWE that will advance the development of medical products and strengthen regulatory
  oversight of medical products across their lifecycle.

***Note:** This living plan is not intended to be comprehensive of all
data-related work being done at HHS. This information is additive to
currently active work and intend to further boost HHS' progress in
leveraging data in support of its mission. Given the multi-year time
frame of this plan, efforts are subject to review and possible change to
maintain alignment with the President's Management Agenda, HHS Secretary
Priorities, and HHS Data Vision.*

  \## Message from the HHS Chief Data Officer---People First, Data Always!

  Fifteen years ago, HHS led the federal Open Data movement and launched HealthData.gov, the home of HHS Open Data. With the publication of this Open Data Plan and a refreshed HealthData.gov launched in July 2025, HHS has refocused its efforts on open data and delivered on three milestones. 1. HHS Open Data Plan (this document) 2. HHS Metadata Standard (version 1.0) 3. HHS Data Inventory (version 1.0 metadata catalog of public and non-public data assets).

  American taxpayers fund HHS data and information, making it essential that these resources are democratized---easily discoverable, machine-readable, and freely accessible to all. All Americans have a right to the information that underpins the Department's operations, federally funded research, and broader "open" initiatives including partnerships, citizen science, crowdsourcing, prizes, and innovation challenges fueled by HHS Open Data. With the maturation of multiple open communities, HHS is
  poised in 2025 to link synergistic ecosystems for increased impact. - Open Data: [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) and [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/) - Open Government: [Open.USA.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/us-open-government) - Open Innovation: [Challenge.gov](https://challenge.gov/) - Open Science: [Science.gov](https://www.science.gov/) - Open Source Code: [Code.gov](https://code.gov/) and [HHS GitHub repo](https://github.com/HHS)

  HHS will improve its ability to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decisions across all levels of the Department. To support this, the HHS Chief Data Officer (CDO) collaborated with data leaders to define shared values for navigating future challenges and change. While the HHS workforce, interagency partners, and external collaborators may differ on data priorities or interpretations, we can all unite around values that drive progress and collaboration with a "sharing by
  default" culture and "open by default" data ethos.

  Core values underpin the HHS Open Data community, underlying every aspect of this plan.\
  **1. TRANSPARENCY:** Radical openness by default.\
  **2. PURPOSE:** Data that serves the public good.\
  **3. RELENTLESS OPTIMIZATION:** Adapt, refine, and improve using agile methods, two-way feedback, a growth mindset, and accountability.\
  **4. EXCELLENCE:** Real-world evidence drives impact.\
  **5. RESPECT:** People and patients as equal partners.\
  **6. INTEGRITY:** Find the truth. Tell the truth.

  Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the HHS Open Data ecosystem---a community of solvers, collaboratively co-creating a more transparent, accountable, and responsive HHS. Today, we have incredible opportunity to responsibly share data, eliminate silos, modernize government, and drive progress through partnerships and emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). All are welcome---join us! People first, data always!

  \## HHS Objectives, Values, and Return on Investment (ROI) with Data

  HHS is trusted with personal data by all Americans, patients, and clinicians alike. HHS must honor that trust, by keeping data private, while delivering value and rewarding individuals for investing their data and digital stories with us. The HHS Open Data approach ensures that the healthcare system is fully informed with HHS data, ensuring that patients benefit from downstream data marketplace and ecosystems, while balancing the need to minimize unnecessary risks to the individual, including
  privacy harms and confidentiality, embracing our responsibilities.

  Change will move at the speed of trust. Trust may be defined as "consistency over time" and this Living Plan acknowledges that HHS can do more to build trust in the ecosystem. Rebuilding and strengthening the public's trust in HHS data is paramount for HHS Open Data success, and change is here. In 2025, HHS recommits to reliably sharing high-quality data, consistently engaging with radical transparency, adopting "open" methods (e.g., [Open Science](https://www.science.gov/), [Open
  Innovation](https://challenge.gov/), [Open Source Code](https://github.com/HHS)), and openly communicating with opportunities for two-way public engagements, events, and public-private partnerships.

  \### Open Methods to Improve the Living HHS Open Data Plan

  This Living Plan satisfies Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements for the Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (Evidence Act) of 2018 Title II---also known as the Open, Public, Electronic, and Necessary (OPEN) Data Government Act---but its purpose transcends mere box-checking. When Open Data is reduced to a compliance task, organizations lose the transformative spirit of transparency and collaboration. Impactful Open Data requires a cultural shift at every level of an organization,
  embracing a mindset of "share by default" and "open by default" to democratize access to information as a public good. By distributing power to the people, the future of HHS Open Data aims to empower Americans with timely, machine-readable, high-quality, freely available data from all HHS Divisions, while lifting new data governance models to give U.S. citizens and patients more agency and control over their own data.

  This Living HHS Open Data Plan is designed to evolve with public input and feedback. It is modular, so each chapter is its own independent GitHub file for the public to submit issues and ideas, in response to a general HHS request for public input and comments. The HHS GitHub "Tell Us About Your Experience with the HHS Open Data Plan" is an online form with open-ended space for public response. With this agile approach, HHS aims to avoid the pitfalls of bureaucratic compliance while maintaining
  focus on the ultimate goal: fostering collaboration and unlocking the transformative power of data for operational efficiency, scientific discovery, innovation, and public impact.

  The value of HHS Open Data is far reaching: - **Eliminate silos to improve operational efficiencies:** Streamline data-sharing processes across divisions to reduce redundancies and enhance program effectiveness. - **Drive new business models:** Enable public-private partnerships that leverage HHS data to create innovative solutions for healthcare and human services. - **Fuel American innovation:** Provide researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers with access to high-value datasets that
  catalyze advancements in science, technology, and public health. - **Accelerate scientific breakthroughs:** Facilitate the use of real-world data to inform evidence-based research and policy decisions. - **Demystify government with transparency:** Embrace open methods, work in the open, and pull back the curtain on who, what, where, when, why, and how HHS operates. - **Maximize taxpayers' ROI on HHS data investments:** Ensure that every dollar spent on data collection and management delivers
  measurable benefits to the American people.

  \### Everyday Leadership: Driving Open Data Transformation

  Achieving the goals of the Living Plan requires sustained effort and action across all levels of the HHS workforce. Leadership, managers, data stewards, and staff must integrate data into everyday decision-making. We must all foster a culture where data-guided insights drive understanding and impact. HHS Open Data transformation begins with everyday leadership, where every Federal employee can commit to lead by example and work in the open with transparency to expand trust in the agency, in
  science, and in the data stewarded by HHS. We can all say "yes" by default to responsible data sharing requests, so that historical gatekeeping norms and gatekeeping culture across HHS will be transformed into a data-driven, enabling culture without silos.

  \### Everyone Included: Valuing All Perspectives

  The success of the Living Plan depends on a collective effort across the entire HHS workforce---data stewards, scientists, strategists, communicators, administrators, problem solvers, and innovators---with everyone recommitting to transparency, HHS data, and following the data, wherever the data and science lead. Moreover, HHS must be responsive to the American public's needs, requests, and suggestions for improving the Living Plan, [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/) resources, and
  Departmental initiatives.

  Across all HHS bureaucracy levels in day-to-day work, employees are encouraged to enable a "yes" by default data-sharing culture with transparency to eliminate information silos, while actively answering. All HHS staff can aid this transformation by asking themselves the following three questions.

  **1. How can I responsibly publish more "open by default" data on [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/)?** Remember, the public has a legal right to federal data when expected societal benefits/rewards outweigh expected costs/risks (e.g., balancing accessibility and security while ensuring quality, ethical use, and protection of priority data assets).

  **2. How can I more transparently engage, listen, and respond to citizens and public feedback?** Remember, the Evidence Act mandates "open by default" data and HHS policy advances open science (free public access without paywalls), and successful delivery involves two-way public engagements with responsiveness to citizens.

  **3. How do I ensure, measure, and track real-world impact from my HHS data work?** Responsible data sharing with a "yes" enabling culture is a good step and necessary---yet insufficient---to transform raw data into understanding and insights to guide decisions and actions. All data projects should explicitly define measurable metrics of success that matter to the American people. As civil servants working on HHS data projects, we must hold ourselves accountable to these measurable metrics of
  success that will vary by project, so that HHS data efforts will directly improve service delivery with positive outcomes to U.S. health and human lives.

  Lastly, HHS Open Data is not just about numbers; it is about the people with the human dimensions. With a holistic view of data science, HHS must prioritize the lifting of people and sharing data-driven stories. "[Stories are data with a soul](https://healthdata.gov/)," to paraphrase Brené Brown, and the 2025 HealthData.gov refresh features stories to connect our HHS data with collective purpose.

  By addressing the above questions and embracing a culture of transparency, collaboration, and accountability, HHS commits to unlocking the full potential of its data to enhance the health and well-being of all Americans. Join us!

  \## Unified HHS for Data Sharing

  HHS must come together as one department for successful data lifecycle management that responsibly unlocks HHS Open Data for the public. The nation's health and human services needs are complex---and public health problems are rarely solved by a single federal initiative. Although data is a critical strategic asset for advancing public health, data sharing and interoperability are critical to making people healthier.

  As such, HHS embraces the opportunity to transform itself into an agile Department, responsive to the nation's needs, by leveraging the power of the information available across its multi-agency data assets. Contributors to this Living Plan included HHS staff from:

  1\. **Office of the Secretary and Administration for a Healthy America** (AHA) including: a) **Immediate Office of the Secretary** (IOS) b) **Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration** (ASA) c) **Office of the Assistant Secretary for Financial Resources** (ASFR) d) **Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health** (OASH) e) **Office of the Assistant Secretary for Legislation** (ASL) f) **Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation** (ASPE) g) **Office of the
  Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response** (ASPR) h) **Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs** (ASPA) i) **Office for Civil Rights** (OCR) j) **Office of the General Counsel** (OGC) k) **Office of Global Affairs** (OGA) l) **Office of Inspector General** (OIG) m) **Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs** (IEA) n) **Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology** (ONC), also known as the **Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy**
  (OSTP) 2. **Administration for Children and Families** (ACF) 3. **Administration for Community Living** (ACL) 4. **Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality** (AHRQ) 5. **Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health** (ARPA-H) 6. **Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response** (ASPR) 7. **Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry** (ATSDR) 8. **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** (CDC) 9. **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services** (CMS) 10. **Food and Drug
  Administration** (FDA) 11. **Health Resources and Services Administration** (HRSA) 12. **Indian Health Service** (IHS) 13. **National Institutes of Health** (NIH) 14. **Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration** (SAMHSA)

  The Living Plan will be updated in alignment with new office structures, as new information becomes known about HHS reorganizations.

  \## Data Collection Processes for Open Formats

  HHS is committed to transforming its data collection processes to meet the highest standards of accessibility, usability, and interoperability. By adopting open formats, HHS ensures its data is machine-readable, fostering transparency, operational efficiency, and innovation in alignment with the OPEN Government Data Act. To maximize the value of its data, HHS has embraced the **FAIR-D principles---Findable[^2], Accessible[^3], Interoperable[^4], Reusable[^5], and Delightful[^6][^7],
  (FAIR-D)**---establishing secure, trustworthy, and open-by-default practices. Standardizing procedures and prioritizing Open Data not only increases public access but also drives innovation, economic growth, and accountability. This commitment strengthens government operations, builds public trust, and advances HHS's mission to improve the health and well-being of all Americans.

  \### HHS 2025 Initiatives and Next Steps

  Building upon past achievements, the HHS CDO and data leaders across the Department expect to implement a series of Open Data initiatives in 2025 and beyond:

  \* **Eliminate Information Silos:** In collaboration with HHS leadership, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and the Chief AI Officer (CAIO), the HHS CDO is harnessing the power of HHS Open Data to dismantle barriers to interagency and intra-agency data sharing, creating a "sharing by default" culture across the entire department. Open Data must enable collaboration, improve efficiency, and enhance transparency to achieve U.S. goals outlined in Executive Order 14243: Stopping Waste, Fraud, and
  Abuse[^39][^40], OMB guidance, and HHS Secretary priorities including Make America Health Again (MAHA)[^41][^42][^43], Open Data. \* **Unlock Real-World Data for Impact:** The CDO will focus resources on MAHA priorities, including lifecycle data management and sharing HHS Open Data for public health priorities like the chronic disease crisis. \* **Publish a Comprehensive HHS Data Inventory with DCAT-U.S. 3.0:** The CDO and data leaders will continue to build open APIs and machine-readable
  resources for the public to use the comprehensive HHS Data Inventory, using DCAT-U.S. 3.0 standards. The HHS Data Inventory includes public and non-public data assets from all Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions, giving HHS employees and the public access to a single enterprise inventory in one place for the whole Department to make HHS data discoverable, sharable, (re)useable, and transformed into understanding to guide decisions and actions. \* **Review, Streamline, and Improve HHS Data
  Policy:** In collaboration with HHS leadership, the CXOs---HHS CTO, HHS CAIO, and HHS CDO---will review, adjudicate, and propose changes to HHS data policies for streamlining and improvements to eliminate information silos and facilitate data sharing as a unified HHS. \* **Improve and Reconstitute HHS Data Governance:** New data governance models will be required. HHS CXOs expect to collaborate with the White House, OMB policy experts, and other leadership to reimagine and reconstitute the
  existing HHS Data Governance Board (DGB) led by the CDO. Future HHS DGB iterations must move at today's pace of digital change, while further empowering U.S. citizens and patients to have control over their personal health information. The HHS DGB will need to pioneer novel models of data governance--- likely in tandem with AI governance---so that HHS can learn, grow, and evolve its data governance practices with industry, academia, and all sectors on the frontlines of data use. \* **Underpin
  HHS Partnerships with Transparency:** Transparent data-sharing practices enable collaboration across sectors, aligning crosscutting efforts across multiple sectors to solve real-world challenges. When coupled with radical transparency, public-private partnerships can increase public trust through transparency, the co-creation of solutions, and the delivery of measurable impact with results faster than government alone. \* **Catalyze American Innovation:** Open access to HHS Open Data drives
  scientific discovery, entrepreneurial breakthroughs, and technological advancements, positioning the United States as a global leader in health innovation. \* **Fuel Emerging Technologies and AI:** By making high-quality, machine-readable data accessible, HHS empowers the development of cutting-edge technologies and AI solutions that enhance healthcare delivery, operational efficiency, and public health outcomes. Please let HHS know of other emerging trends, technologies, and priorities with
  public benefit that are missing and should be featured in the Living HHS Open Data Plan.

  \### Action Plan and Timeline (2025--2028)

  HHS has outlined a phased approach to achieve its open data objectives in Table 1 -- HHS Open Data Action Plan below.

  [^49]: https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/nih-cms-partner-to-research-root-causes-of-autism.html

  \## Data Usage Information

  HHS data usage statistics are available at <https://healthdata.gov/metrics>. The top 1,000 data assets are dynamically displayed and easily discoverable on the HHS Open Data Resources page at \[URL link\]. HHS is also part of the U.S. General Services Administration [Digital Analytics Program (DAP)](https://digital.gov/guides/dap)[^50] that enables federal agencies to understand how the public finds, accesses, and uses government services online.

  Data usage information is anonymous, as it includes only summary statistics. This reflects HHS's unwavering commitment to protect individual privacy and ensure compliance with the Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other federal regulations.

  **Protecting Privacy and Ensuring Compliance:** In data usage tracking efforts, HHS maintains an unwavering commitment to protecting individual privacy and ensuring compliance with HIPAA and all federal regulations. Data usage information is collected, de-identified for protection of individual privacy, and analyzed in aggregate form, with stringent measures in place to prevent the identification of individual users or the compromise of sensitive information.

  **Tracking and Analytics to Inform Decision Making:** Insights gleaned from HHS data usage information inform HHS policy-making and resource allocation. By understanding which websites and datasets are most frequently accessed and how they are being used, HHS can better align Open Data efforts with public needs and scientific research priorities.

  **Transparency and Reporting:** HHS regularly publishes reports on data usage statistics and trends[^51][^52][^53]. These reports provide valuable insights to both internal stakeholders and the public, fostering a culture of openness and accountability in our data management practices.

  **Collaborations and Partnerships for Enhanced Insights:** To extract additional understanding and value from HHS data usage information, HHS engages in strategic collaborations through the CDO Council, other federal agencies, and public-private partnerships. Such collaborations enable a more sophisticated analysis of data usage trends, many of which are available on Data.gov[^54] and the interagency Digital Analytics Program (DAP)[^55].

  HHS communicates the usage and value of its data at public-facing engagements and events including technology sprints, innovation sprints, demo days, and other opportunities that showcase data usage information. HHS features select data usage information through the HealthData.gov/stories , also known as the HealthData.gov blog.

  Data usage information must guide the HHS Open Data strategy, illuminating the path to maximum efficiency, economic growth, scientific discovery, and public impact. By tracking and analyzing how HHS data is accessed and utilized, we transform raw statistics into actionable insights. See Appendix C -- HHS Open Data Action Items with Timeline, for the Living HHS Open Data action plan with 2025 -- 2028 timeline.

  \## Prioritizing Public Data Asset Review

  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is committed to fostering innovation, transparency, and collaboration through our data-sharing initiatives. A critical component of an HHS Open Data Strategy will be to identify and publish priority public datasets, focusing on high-impact, transformative data resources.

  Criteria for prioritizing datasets may include:

  1\. **Artificial Intelligence and Innovation:** Datasets used to develop, test, or measure the performance of artificial intelligence systems, driving cutting-edge advancements in healthcare and human services.

  2\. **Public Impact and Mission Alignment:** Information with significant potential to impact public health, further the core mission of HHS agencies, or meet critical needs of the Federal Government.

  3\. **Efficient Service and Benefit Delivery:** Datasets supporting the delivery of essential services or benefits to the public, including information sharing to streamline, simplify, and improve HHS processes to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our programs.

  4\. **Scientific and Technological Progress:** Data with high potential to spur innovation, accelerate science, or drive technological advancements in health and human services.

  5\. **High-Demand and Timely Topics:** Datasets related to pressing public health issues may be subject to frequent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and are made visible to the public in the HHS FOIA Reading Room[^62]. This FOIA demand signal demonstrates high public interest or usage, and the HHS CDO evaluating how to use FOIA requests to help prioritize HHS Open Data workflows and department-wide processes.

  [^63]: https://www.hhs.gov/foia/electronic-reading-room/

  We believe these focused criteria will ensure our data resources provide maximum value to our partners in the private sector, public institutions, and non-profit organizations. By prioritizing these high-impact datasets, we aim to facilitate groundbreaking research, inform critical policy decisions, and drive innovations that can transform healthcare and human services.

  We encourage all our partners to engage with these datasets and provide feedback on their utility and impact. Together, we can leverage the power of data to address critical health challenges, enhance service delivery, and improve the well-being of all Americans.

  See Appendix C - HHS Open Data Action Items with Timeline, for the Living HHS Open Data action plan with 2025 -- 2028 timeline.

  \## Improving Processes for Meeting Open Data Goals

  Data is central to the HHS mission, which includes regulating food, drugs, medical products, and much more. Per the requirements of the OPEN Government Data Act[^64], the HHS CDO will update this section of the Living HHS Open Data Plan following the Department's reorganization.

  [^65]: OMB M-25-05, at 28-29.

  \> HHS agencies release data into "electronic reading rooms" once a low threshold of public inquiries is reached through FOIA requests -- [such as this site at HRSA](https://www.hrsa.gov/foia/electronic-reading).

  See Appendix C - HHS Open Data Action Items with Timeline, for the Living HHS Open Data action plan with 2025 -- 2028 timeline.

  \## Intra-HHS Data Sharing --- Be the Change

  HHS data-driven delivery relies on its ability to securely and ethically share information across all its HHS Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions for the collaborative solving of pressing public health needs. To this end, HHS views its data is an enterprise resource, and not a series of collections scattered across government silos.

  The HHS CTO and Chief Information Officer (CIO) are leading information technology (IT) enterprise-wide integration and modernization, working closely with the CDO to create one umbrella as a unified Department with shared, enterprise-wide capabilities to:

  \* **Eliminate silos to improve operational efficiencies:** Publishing its data assets in a centralized, secure data catalog in Healthdata.gov. Ensuring the data is machine-readable to the extent possible and Linking data through secure, cloud-based lake house interchanges \* **Accelerate scientific breakthroughs:** Unlocking the use of real-world data products and services to leads departments and agencies to develop new insights and enables Departments and HHS to make more informed
  evidence-based decisions. By bringing together program leads with shared goals and develop appropriate, cross-cutting to strategically advance the Department's most pressing public health priorities and solve the most critical operational needs as a result it will stream data related procurements. \* **Demystify government with transparency:** Strategically close interoperability gaps through cross-agency collaboration and establishment of common data terms and definitions and single "sources
  of truth". Promote data literacy across Department staff. \* **Drive new business models:** Enhances the Health Data marketplace features, by streamlining data procurements and third-party purchases. Eliminated need for conducting data calls, data use agreements by sharing data products and services built by various departments to address HHS's mission. Finding unified enterprise data management solutions and avoid the unnecessary use of countless non-communicating data platforms and analytic
  tools \* **Fuel American innovation:** Catalyzes the advancement in the specialized data products and services with access to high-value datasets developed by various departments. Such as optimize automation and ethical use of artificial intelligence tools to showcase specialized data services to eliminate redundant and duplicate activities around data cleanup, validation and data transformation. \* **Maximize taxpayers' ROI on HHS data investments:** Ensure that every dollar spent on data
  collection and management delivers measurable benefits to the American people. HHS Divisions shall use opportunities to collaborate and coordinate their data-driven public health activities through bringing together agency data leaders in venues such as the HHS Data Governance Board and HHS Data Council. Within these venues, agency data leaders will identify critical gaps and develop and implement plans to efficiently and effectively resolve them -- ultimately to ensure the proper stewardship
  of taxpayer dollars and optimal service to the public.

  \## Real-World Data for Impact

  The entire "spirit" of the [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174), for which the OPEN Government Data Act is Title II, is to ask and answer questions (build evidence) to support policymaking---meaning that federal agencies should collect, use, and acquire data to apply it in ways for the betterment of the nation. This includes rigorous application of the scientific method to test scientific hypotheses, while
  following the data wherever the data lead. HHS, like all of Federal government, should always use data to maximize the impact of science, programs, and services for the common good.

  Real-world data (RWD[^66]), sometimes called real-world evidence (RWE[^67]), align with HHS Open Data values and goals to drive healthcare innovation, transparency, and improved outcomes. HHS promotes open access to and interoperability of RWD, including HIPAA-compliant information from electronic health records, insurance claims, and patient registries.

  [^68]: https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/nih-cms-partner-to-research-root-causes-of-autism.html [^69]: https://www.fda.gov/science-research/science-and-research-special-topics/real-world-evidence

  \> Real-World Data provides a foundation for a "Learning Health System" that can rapidly adapt to changing circumstances, emergent diseases, and enable learning from the treatment of patients to inform others with the same condition.

  This real-world approach enables diverse stakeholders, such as regulators and payers, to gain insights from routine clinical care---the real-world and provides a foundation for a "Learning Health System" that can rapidly adapt to changing circumstances, emergent diseases, and enable learning from the treatment of patients to inform others with the same condition. By adopting "open by default", while safeguarding individual privacy, HHS aims to leverage high-quality RWD/RWE, clinical evidence
  regarding the usage, and potential benefits or risks, of a medical product derived from analysis of RWD/RWE. Such interdisciplinary analyses and results will inform regulatory decisions, evaluate treatments, and accelerate effective care delivery, supporting evidence-based policymaking and patient-centered healthcare.

  At the core of the Living HHS Open Data Plan for RWD lies the concept that data is a "public utility" for good that powers scientific advancement, innovation, and progress. Public utilities exist because the community has recognized that the service or product, they provide is essential to the life and health of Americans. In today's world, the public needs access to healthcare and public health data, which allows individuals to take control of their own health and allows aggregate, anonymized,
  deidentified data to be leveraged for innovation.

  HHS supports public and private partnerships for data utility models that increases data access for public consumers, including patients, providers, payers, state agencies, and researchers. The health utility concept is emerging today based on lessons learned from early gains by Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), and by expanding the role of HIEs into a public utility or Health Data Utilities (HDUs). HIEs have provided critical and timely patient data to aid in treatment across health care
  providers, but new governance models will be necessary to empower patients and ensure HHS transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to citizen prioritizes and real-world needs.

  The on-going HIEs evolution into HDUs is opportunity for the HHS CDO and partners to pilot novel data governance methods and pioneer new approaches to interoperability. This progress with HIEs is informative and important, yet alone it is not sufficient to enable a nationwide learning health system. The CDO expects to pilot novel data governance models with industry, academia, non-profit organizations, and all sectors---including individuals with lived experiences, like patients and caregivers,
  as partners---to co-create new modes of data governance in collaboration with HHS.

  In a learning health system, cancer treatment becomes more precise and effective as clinicians can find other patients with similar tumor characteristics, especially genomically similar tumors, and enable clinicians to learn what treatments are or are not effective enabling better and more tailored treatment with the right interventions, earlier in the course of the disease. Similar use cases for the health public utility exist for rare disease treatment; with sufficient data, the health public
  utility can support much more rapid diagnosis and treatment. Beyond the learning health system, such a public utility for health data provides the foundation for improved bio-surveillance, detection and analysis of adverse events from drugs, devices and biologics, as well as for research. In some respects, more importantly, such a public utility supports radical transparency for patients, both in terms of expanding comprehensive access to their medical history and for the ability of the public
  to understand how their data is being used, by whom and to understand the benefits from that use of their data.

  A public utility model for good and radical transparency relies on a Patient Trust Model. This model refers to the relationship between patients and their healthcare organizations regarding their health information. By providing patients control over their information and data and allowing for permissioning of their data through a health data utility creates the necessary components for a learning health system. Key elements of the Patient Trust Model includes data security and privacy,
  transparency and engagement, patient empowerment, and return of results to improve healthcare, which is a goal for a learning health system. In some ways this concept is similar to the Brazil's patient data model that is governed by the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD)[^70]. The LGPD grants patients access control over their data including data sharing and transparency on data use.

  [^71]: Brazil General Data Protection Law (LGPD), Law No. 13.709/2018 https://iapp.org/resources/article/brazilian-data-protection-law-lgpd-english-translation/

  The health data utility model can also work to empower patients to take control of their own data, share it selectively with their clinical care team, and if willing, to opt in to specific research studies.

  \* **Standards:** HHS supports divisions to develop specific RWD standards, for example to meet a regulatory requirement. RWD should meet the three accepted metadata standards currently handled by Data.gov. Standards are also needed to facilitate the interoperability of data required to integrate disparate data sources, for example, it is likely that the emerging market pattern of HIEs becoming state based HPUs, will continue necessitating a federated approach to a national HPU resource.

  \* **Fit for purpose:** Agencies must ensure they have clear policies for evaluating and communicating the fitness-for-purpose, or sometimes called "fit for use", of RWD made available to the public. Agencies should supply adequate documentation for each released RWD to help users assess whether the data is suitable for their intended use. Practices may include creating a standard template or framework that offers users the necessary context and details and creation of mechanisms for
  transparent use of data and patient consent perhaps using an immutable ledger such as Blockchain.

  \* **Terms of Use:** RWD in the HHS ecosystem is open by default and should align with the privacy policy, data policy, and accessibility terms at Data.gov. When acquiring data, agencies should reduce the use of bespoke and custom terms in data use agreements, which would restrict ability to release data as Open Data. Agencies should consider multiple approaches to acquisitions and collection of data, including incorporating data agreements in the contracting or grant terms, and not in separate
  agreements. This can multiply the impact of federal funding, by ensuring that federal funding results in data available as a common good.

  \### Completed RWD Projects Advancing HHS Open Data

  \* FDA has a long history of using RWD and RWE to monitor and evaluate the post-market safety of authorized medical products. Advances in the availability and analysis of RWD have increased the potential for generating robust RWE to support regulatory decisions.

  \* Completed FDA initiatives recently focused on advancing the use of RWD and RWE in regulatory decision-making and on informing healthcare policy. FDA finalized guidance documents on use of RWE (including electronic health records (EHRs), medical claims data and registries) to support regulatory decisions for biologics, devices, and drugs. Recent FDA initiatives also cover study design considerations, and procedural and regulatory requirements.

  \* CMS released an updated guidance document in 2024 that describes coverage with evidence development (CED).

  \* CDC Data Channels exemplify open data principles by integrating diverse data sources into user-friendly visualizations and plain language interpretations. These channels empower the public with clear insights into issues related to infectious diseases, like [respiratory illnesses](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html), as well as other important health topics, such as [mental health](https://www.cdc.gov/mental-health/about-data/index.html).

  \* CDC's Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology has a dedicated team of data journalists, designers, and data experts that collaborate with CDC programs and emergency responses to design these channels, ensuring creation of audience-specific material and timely updates. Underlying data sources are made available at [data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/), enhancing transparency and enabling data reuse.

  \* CDC makes multiple other online data tools available to users. This includes [CDC WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) where users can create custom queries of vital records and other key public health data, providing them with up-to-date detailed information on health outcomes such as causes of death. By tailoring content and access points for various audiences, CDC enhances communication on urgent public health threats and accessibility to data to foster engagement and trust with the public.

  \### Ongoing RWD Initiatives Advancing HHS Open Data

  \* The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) is conducting market research for potential procurements for real world health care data and related services.

  \* With participation from multiple HHS divisions, the National Academy of Medicine has ongoing studies and convenings relating to the Learning Health System and Public Utility model and plan to issues reports and recommendations in the next year.

  \* The NIH is planning for the development of a RWD research platform to support research generally (e.g., National Clinical Cohort Collaborative \[N3C\]) with initial focus on the causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). N3C infrastructure will also benefit other data-driven priorities like understanding nutrition for health, chronic diseases, environmental toxin exposures, and the benefits of healthy lifestyles.

  \* NIH/NCATS Open Data Portal was created to share and visualize data in real time to accelerate discover and guide the exploration of new therapeutic hypotheses. Open Data Portal is built to quickly pivot and share data for emerging public health needs and is expanding to include data for other diseases.

  \* FDA is committed to realizing the full potential of fit-for-purpose RWD to generate RWE that will advance the development of medical products and strengthen regulatory oversight of medical products across their lifecycle.

## Message from the HHS Chief Data Officer---People First, Data Always!

Fifteen years ago, HHS led the federal Open Data movement and launched
HealthData.gov, the home of HHS Open Data. With the publication of this
Open Data Plan and a refreshed HealthData.gov launched in July 2025, HHS
has refocused its efforts on open data and delivered on three
milestones. 1. HHS Open Data Plan (this document) 2. HHS Metadata
Standard (version 1.0) 3. HHS Data Inventory (version 1.0 metadata
catalog of public and non-public data assets).

American taxpayers fund HHS data and information, making it essential
that these resources are democratized---easily discoverable,
machine-readable, and freely accessible to all. All Americans have a
right to the information that underpins the Department's operations,
federally funded research, and broader "open" initiatives including
partnerships, citizen science, crowdsourcing, prizes, and innovation
challenges fueled by HHS Open Data. With the maturation of multiple open
communities, HHS is poised in 2025 to link synergistic ecosystems for
increased impact. - Open Data: [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) and
[HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/) - Open Government:
[Open.USA.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/us-open-government) -
Open Innovation: [Challenge.gov](https://challenge.gov/) - Open Science:
[Science.gov](https://www.science.gov/) - Open Source Code:
[Code.gov](https://code.gov/) and [HHS GitHub
repo](https://github.com/HHS)

HHS will improve its ability to transform raw data into actionable
insights that guide decisions across all levels of the Department. To
support this, the HHS Chief Data Officer (CDO) collaborated with data
leaders to define shared values for navigating future challenges and
change. While the HHS workforce, interagency partners, and external
collaborators may differ on data priorities or interpretations, we can
all unite around values that drive progress and collaboration with a
"sharing by default" culture and "open by default" data ethos.

Core values underpin the HHS Open Data community, underlying every
aspect of this plan.\\ **1. TRANSPARENCY:** Radical openness by
default.\\ **2. PURPOSE:** Data that serves the public good.\\ **3.
RELENTLESS OPTIMIZATION:** Adapt, refine, and improve using agile
methods, two-way feedback, a growth mindset, and accountability.\\ **4.
EXCELLENCE:** Real-world evidence drives impact.\\ **5. RESPECT:**
People and patients as equal partners.\\ **6. INTEGRITY:** Find the
truth. Tell the truth.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the HHS Open Data
ecosystem---a community of solvers, collaboratively co-creating a more
transparent, accountable, and responsive HHS. Today, we have incredible
opportunity to responsibly share data, eliminate silos, modernize
government, and drive progress through partnerships and emerging
technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). All are welcome---join
us! People first, data always!

HHS is trusted with personal data by all Americans, patients, and
clinicians alike. HHS must honor that trust, by keeping data private,
while delivering value and rewarding individuals for investing their
data and digital stories with us. The HHS Open Data approach ensures
that the healthcare system is fully informed with HHS data, ensuring
that patients benefit from downstream data marketplace and ecosystems,
while balancing the need to minimize unnecessary risks to the
individual, including privacy harms and confidentiality, embracing our
responsibilities.

Change will move at the speed of trust. Trust may be defined as
"consistency over time" and this Living Plan acknowledges that HHS can
do more to build trust in the ecosystem. Rebuilding and strengthening
the public's trust in HHS data is paramount for HHS Open Data success,
and change is here. In 2025, HHS recommits to reliably sharing
high-quality data, consistently engaging with radical transparency,
adopting "open" methods (e.g., [Open Science](https://www.science.gov/),
[Open Innovation](https://challenge.gov/), [Open Source
Code](https://github.com/HHS)), and openly communicating with
opportunities for two-way public engagements, events, and public-private
partnerships.

### Open Methods to Improve the Living HHS Open Data Plan

This Living Plan satisfies Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
requirements for the Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (Evidence Act) of
2018 Title II---also known as the Open, Public, Electronic, and
Necessary (OPEN) Data Government Act---but its purpose transcends mere
box-checking. When Open Data is reduced to a compliance task,
organizations lose the transformative spirit of transparency and
collaboration. Impactful Open Data requires a cultural shift at every
level of an organization, embracing a mindset of "share by default" and
"open by default" to democratize access to information as a public good.
By distributing power to the people, the future of HHS Open Data aims to
empower Americans with timely, machine-readable, high-quality, freely
available data from all HHS Divisions, while lifting new data governance
models to give U.S. citizens and patients more agency and control over
their own data.

This Living HHS Open Data Plan is designed to evolve with public input
and feedback. It is modular, so each chapter is its own independent
GitHub file for the public to submit issues and ideas, in response to a
general HHS request for public input and comments. The HHS GitHub "Tell
Us About Your Experience with the HHS Open Data Plan" is an online form
with open-ended space for public response. With this agile approach, HHS
aims to avoid the pitfalls of bureaucratic compliance while maintaining
focus on the ultimate goal: fostering collaboration and unlocking the
transformative power of data for operational efficiency, scientific
discovery, innovation, and public impact.

The value of HHS Open Data is far reaching: - **Eliminate silos to
improve operational efficiencies:** Streamline data-sharing processes
across divisions to reduce redundancies and enhance program
effectiveness. - **Drive new business models:** Enable public-private
partnerships that leverage HHS data to create innovative solutions for
healthcare and human services. - **Fuel American innovation:** Provide
researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers with access to high-value
datasets that catalyze advancements in science, technology, and public
health. - **Accelerate scientific breakthroughs:** Facilitate the use of
real-world data to inform evidence-based research and policy
decisions. - **Demystify government with transparency:** Embrace open
methods, work in the open, and pull back the curtain on who, what,
where, when, why, and how HHS operates. - **Maximize taxpayers' ROI on
HHS data investments:** Ensure that every dollar spent on data
collection and management delivers measurable benefits to the American
people.

### Everyday Leadership: Driving Open Data Transformation

Achieving the goals of the Living Plan requires sustained effort and
action across all levels of the HHS workforce. Leadership, managers,
data stewards, and staff must integrate data into everyday
decision-making. We must all foster a culture where data-guided insights
drive understanding and impact. HHS Open Data transformation begins with
everyday leadership, where every Federal employee can commit to lead by
example and work in the open with transparency to expand trust in the
agency, in science, and in the data stewarded by HHS. We can all say
"yes" by default to responsible data sharing requests, so that
historical gatekeeping norms and gatekeeping culture across HHS will be
transformed into a data-driven, enabling culture without silos.

### Everyone Included: Valuing All Perspectives

The success of the Living Plan depends on a collective effort across the
entire HHS workforce---data stewards, scientists, strategists,
communicators, administrators, problem solvers, and innovators---with
everyone recommitting to transparency, HHS data, and following the data,
wherever the data and science lead. Moreover, HHS must be responsive to
the American public's needs, requests, and suggestions for improving the
Living Plan, [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/) resources, and
Departmental initiatives.

Across all HHS bureaucracy levels in day-to-day work, employees are
encouraged to enable a "yes" by default data-sharing culture with
transparency to eliminate information silos, while actively answering.
All HHS staff can aid this transformation by asking themselves the
following three questions.

**1. How can I responsibly publish more "open by default" data on
[HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/)?** Remember, the public has a
legal right to federal data when expected societal benefits/rewards
outweigh expected costs/risks (e.g., balancing accessibility and
security while ensuring quality, ethical use, and protection of priority
data assets).

**2. How can I more transparently engage, listen, and respond to
citizens and public feedback?** Remember, the Evidence Act mandates
"open by default" data and HHS policy advances open science (free public
access without paywalls), and successful delivery involves two-way
public engagements with responsiveness to citizens.

**3. How do I ensure, measure, and track real-world impact from my HHS
data work?** Responsible data sharing with a "yes" enabling culture is a
good step and necessary---yet insufficient---to transform raw data into
understanding and insights to guide decisions and actions. All data
projects should explicitly define measurable metrics of success that
matter to the American people. As civil servants working on HHS data
projects, we must hold ourselves accountable to these measurable metrics
of success that will vary by project, so that HHS data efforts will
directly improve service delivery with positive outcomes to U.S. health
and human lives.

Lastly, HHS Open Data is not just about numbers; it is about the people
with the human dimensions. With a holistic view of data science, HHS
must prioritize the lifting of people and sharing data-driven stories.
"[Stories are data with a soul](https://healthdata.gov/)," to paraphrase
Brené Brown, and the 2025 HealthData.gov refresh features stories to
connect our HHS data with collective purpose.

By addressing the above questions and embracing a culture of
transparency, collaboration, and accountability, HHS commits to
unlocking the full potential of its data to enhance the health and
well-being of all Americans. Join us!

## Unified HHS for Data Sharing

HHS must come together as one department for successful data lifecycle
management that responsibly unlocks HHS Open Data for the public. The
nation's health and human services needs are complex---and public health
problems are rarely solved by a single federal initiative. Although data
is a critical strategic asset for advancing public health, data sharing
and interoperability are critical to making people healthier.

As such, HHS embraces the opportunity to transform itself into an agile
Department, responsive to the nation's needs, by leveraging the power of
the information available across its multi-agency data assets.

## Data Collection Processes for Open Formats

HHS is committed to transforming its data collection processes to meet
the highest standards of accessibility, usability, and interoperability.
By adopting open formats, HHS ensures its data is machine-readable,
fostering transparency, operational efficiency, and innovation in
alignment with the OPEN Government Data Act. To maximize the value of
its data, HHS has embraced the **FAIR-D principles---Findable[^73],
Accessible[^74], Interoperable[^75], Reusable[^76], and
Delightful[^77][^78], (FAIR-D)**---establishing secure, trustworthy, and
open-by-default practices. Standardizing procedures and prioritizing
Open Data not only increases public access but also drives innovation,
economic growth, and accountability. This commitment strengthens
government operations, builds public trust, and advances HHS's mission
to improve the health and well-being of all Americans.

### Completed Projects

Open Data collection practices are on-going with continuous improvements
(marked with asterisk\*) to select HHS completed projects:

- **Envisioned and launched HealthData.gov[^79]**\* 15 years ago,
  spearheading the federal Open Data movement prior to Data.gov, as the
  home of government Open Data.
  - **Open.FDA.gov[^80]**, publishes usage metrics since its launch,
    similar to HealthData.gov with digital analytics and metrics. This
    has helped FDA build awareness on the value of the public data sets
    to drive innovation and effectiveness of initiatives targeting
    adverse events, drug shortages, food/product recalls, and FDA
    regulatory decisions.
- **Pioneered responsible data sharing practices[^81]**\* in both Open
  Data and Open Science, developing risk-informed approaches to weigh
  and balance the expected societal rewards/benefits of information
  disclosures with the expected societal risks/costs.
- **Delivered U.S. Open Government[^82]** progress through Open Data and
  data-driven innovation by listening and responding to citizens'
  campaigns that catalyzed HHS action to address America's opioid
  crisis, suicide prevention, and Lyme and tick-borne diseases.
- **Enhanced Transparency and Accessibility of Federal Spending Data
  through the DATA Act** by implementing an automated monthly process to
  report contracts, grants, and financial assistance spending data to
  [USASpending.gov](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usaspending.gov%2F&data=05%7C02%7CKristen.Honey%40hhs.gov%7Ca4e2e8456abf4fa66c9c08ddbe27a3dc%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C638875799635902074%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=uyAZEHnhVIt1DIzoBJ8lCY2fjVnLLPBKkrkGDsNgA2E%3D&reserved=0)[^83]
  consistent with the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA
  Act)[^84] strengthening data integrity and resulting in transparency
  to the public regarding how federal dollars are spent.
- **Harnessed the power of Open Data to fuel American Innovation and
  Open innovation**\* and HHS has run more innovation challenges and
  prizes than all other federal agencies[^85].
- **Unlocked information for all citizens through Open Science**\*, with
  HHS housing Science.gov[^86] and PubMed[^87] with over 38 million
  citations for biomedical literature with underlying data available to
  everyone without paywalls[^88]. See the Open Science Disclosure Risk
  Management: A Workshop Report and Corresponding Recommendations for
  the Federal Research Community[^89] in Appendix B (Open Science
  Disclosure Risk Management (2019 NSTC SOS)).
- **Pioneered Public Engagements, Health Datapaloozas[^90], and Tech
  Sprints like TOP/TOPx[^91]**\* to showcase and celebrate Open Data for
  impact using a variety of HHS tech sprints, innovation sprints,
  hackathons, "Healthathons," Datapaloozas, and other public-facing
  engagements with events fueled by
  [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/), the home of HHS Open Data.
- **Published a HHS Metadata Standard**\*---accompanying this Living
  Plan in July 2025---with a public call-to-action for feedback to
  improve the standard with future iterations.
- **Published the HHS Data Inventory**\*---accompanying this Living Plan
  in July 2025---with a public call-to-action to establish a
  comprehensive metadata inventory of public and non-public data assts
  managed by HHS in machine-readable, open formats.
- **Published the Living HHS Open Data Plan**\*---this document with
  accompanying [GitHub Living HHS Open Data
  Plan](https://github.com/HHS/hhs-open-data-plan) for two-way, open,
  public suggestions for continuous improvements. Please let HHS know of
  other completed projects with public benefit that are missing and
  should be featured in the Living HHS Open Data Plan.

### HHS 2025 Initiatives and Next Steps

Building upon past achievements, the HHS CDO and data leaders across the
Department expect to implement a series of Open Data initiatives in 2025
and beyond:

- **Eliminate Information Silos:** In collaboration with HHS leadership,
  Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and the Chief AI Officer (CAIO), the
  HHS CDO is harnessing the power of HHS Open Data to dismantle barriers
  to interagency and intra-agency data sharing, creating a "sharing by
  default" culture across the entire department. Open Data must enable
  collaboration, improve efficiency, and enhance transparency to achieve
  U.S. goals outlined in Executive Order 14243: Stopping Waste, Fraud,
  and Abuse[^92][^93], OMB guidance, and HHS Secretary priorities
  including Make America Health Again (MAHA)[^94][^95][^96], Open Data.
- **Unlock Real-World Data for Impact:** The CDO will focus resources on
  MAHA priorities, including lifecycle data management and sharing HHS
  Open Data for public health priorities like the chronic disease
  crisis.
- **Publish a Comprehensive HHS Data Inventory with DCAT-U.S. 3.0:** The
  CDO and data leaders will continue to build open APIs and
  machine-readable resources for the public to use the comprehensive HHS
  Data Inventory, using DCAT-U.S. 3.0 standards. The HHS Data Inventory
  includes public and non-public data assets from all Operating
  Divisions and Staff Divisions, giving HHS employees and the public
  access to a single enterprise inventory in one place for the whole
  Department to make HHS data discoverable, sharable, (re)useable, and
  transformed into understanding to guide decisions and actions.
- **Review, Streamline, and Improve HHS Data Policy:** In collaboration
  with HHS leadership, the CXOs---HHS CTO, HHS CAIO, and HHS CDO---will
  review, adjudicate, and propose changes to HHS data policies for
  streamlining and improvements to eliminate information silos and
  facilitate data sharing as a unified HHS.
- **Improve and Reconstitute HHS Data Governance:** New data governance
  models will be required. HHS CXOs expect to collaborate with the White
  House, OMB policy experts, and other leadership to reimagine and
  reconstitute the existing HHS Data Governance Board (DGB) led by the
  CDO. Future HHS DGB iterations must move at today's pace of digital
  change, while further empowering U.S. citizens and patients to have
  control over their personal health information. The HHS DGB will need
  to pioneer novel models of data governance--- likely in tandem with AI
  governance---so that HHS can learn, grow, and evolve its data
  governance practices with industry, academia, and all sectors on the
  frontlines of data use.
- **Underpin HHS Partnerships with Transparency:** Transparent
  data-sharing practices enable collaboration across sectors, aligning
  crosscutting efforts across multiple sectors to solve real-world
  challenges. When coupled with radical transparency, public-private
  partnerships can increase public trust through transparency, the
  co-creation of solutions, and the delivery of measurable impact with
  results faster than government alone.
- **Catalyze American Innovation:** Open access to HHS Open Data drives
  scientific discovery, entrepreneurial breakthroughs, and technological
  advancements, positioning the United States as a global leader in
  health innovation.
- **Fuel Emerging Technologies and AI:** By making high-quality,
  machine-readable data accessible, HHS empowers the development of
  cutting-edge technologies and AI solutions that enhance healthcare
  delivery, operational efficiency, and public health outcomes. Please
  let HHS know of other emerging trends, technologies, and priorities
  with public benefit that are missing and should be featured in the
  Living HHS Open Data Plan.

## Data Usage Information

HHS data usage statistics are available at
<https://healthdata.gov/metrics>. The top 1,000 data assets are
dynamically displayed and easily discoverable on the HHS Open Data
Resources page at \[URL link\]. HHS is also part of the U.S. General
Services Administration [Digital Analytics Program
(DAP)](https://digital.gov/guides/dap)[^98] that enables federal
agencies to understand how the public finds, accesses, and uses
government services online.

Data usage information is anonymous, as it includes only summary
statistics. This reflects HHS's unwavering commitment to protect
individual privacy and ensure compliance with the Privacy Act, Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other federal
regulations.

**Protecting Privacy and Ensuring Compliance:** In data usage tracking
efforts, HHS maintains an unwavering commitment to protecting individual
privacy and ensuring compliance with HIPAA and all federal regulations.
Data usage information is collected, de-identified for protection of
individual privacy, and analyzed in aggregate form, with stringent
measures in place to prevent the identification of individual users or
the compromise of sensitive information.

**Tracking and Analytics to Inform Decision Making:** Insights gleaned
from HHS data usage information inform HHS policy-making and resource
allocation. By understanding which websites and datasets are most
frequently accessed and how they are being used, HHS can better align
Open Data efforts with public needs and scientific research priorities.

**Transparency and Reporting:** HHS regularly publishes reports on data
usage statistics and trends[^99][^100][^101]. These reports provide
valuable insights to both internal stakeholders and the public,
fostering a culture of openness and accountability in our data
management practices.

**Collaborations and Partnerships for Enhanced Insights:** To extract
additional understanding and value from HHS data usage information, HHS
engages in strategic collaborations through the CDO Council, other
federal agencies, and public-private partnerships. Such collaborations
enable a more sophisticated analysis of data usage trends, many of which
are available on Data.gov[^102] and the interagency Digital Analytics
Program (DAP)[^103].

HHS communicates the usage and value of its data at public-facing
engagements and events including technology sprints, innovation sprints,
demo days, and other opportunities that showcase data usage information.
HHS features select data usage information through the
HealthData.gov/stories , also known as the HealthData.gov blog.

Data usage information must guide the HHS Open Data strategy,
illuminating the path to maximum efficiency, economic growth, scientific
discovery, and public impact. By tracking and analyzing how HHS data is
accessed and utilized, we transform raw statistics into actionable
insights. See Appendix C -- HHS Open Data Action Items with Timeline,
for the Living HHS Open Data action plan with 2025 -- 2028 timeline.

## Prioritizing Public Data Asset Review

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is committed to
fostering innovation, transparency, and collaboration through our
data-sharing initiatives. A critical component of an HHS Open Data
Strategy will be to identify and publish priority public datasets,
focusing on high-impact, transformative data resources.

Criteria for prioritizing datasets may include:

1.  **Artificial Intelligence and Innovation:** Datasets used to
    develop, test, or measure the performance of artificial intelligence
    systems, driving cutting-edge advancements in healthcare and human
    services.

2.  **Public Impact and Mission Alignment:** Information with
    significant potential to impact public health, further the core
    mission of HHS agencies, or meet critical needs of the Federal
    Government.

3.  **Efficient Service and Benefit Delivery:** Datasets supporting the
    delivery of essential services or benefits to the public, including
    information sharing to streamline, simplify, and improve HHS
    processes to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our
    programs.

4.  **Scientific and Technological Progress:** Data with high potential
    to spur innovation, accelerate science, or drive technological
    advancements in health and human services.

5.  **High-Demand and Timely Topics:** Datasets related to pressing
    public health issues may be subject to frequent Freedom of
    Information Act (FOIA) requests and are made visible to the public
    in the HHS FOIA Reading Room[^104]. This FOIA demand signal
    demonstrates high public interest or usage, and the HHS CDO
    evaluating how to use FOIA requests to help prioritize HHS Open Data
    workflows and department-wide processes.

We believe these focused criteria will ensure our data resources provide
maximum value to our partners in the private sector, public
institutions, and non-profit organizations. By prioritizing these
high-impact datasets, we aim to facilitate groundbreaking research,
inform critical policy decisions, and drive innovations that can
transform healthcare and human services.

We encourage all our partners to engage with these datasets and provide
feedback on their utility and impact. Together, we can leverage the
power of data to address critical health challenges, enhance service
delivery, and improve the well-being of all Americans.

See Appendix C - HHS Open Data Action Items with Timeline, for the
Living HHS Open Data action plan with 2025 -- 2028 timeline.

## Improving Processes for Meeting Open Data Goals

Data is central to the HHS mission, which includes regulating food,
drugs, medical products, and much more. Per the requirements of the OPEN
Government Data Act[^105], the HHS CDO will update this section of the
Living HHS Open Data Plan following the Department's reorganization.

> HHS agencies release data into "electronic reading rooms" once a low
> threshold of public inquiries is reached through FOIA requests --
> [such as this site at
> HRSA](https://www.hrsa.gov/foia/electronic-reading).

## Intra-HHS Data Sharing --- Be the Change

HHS data-driven delivery relies on its ability to securely and ethically
share information across all its HHS Operating Divisions and Staff
Divisions for the collaborative solving of pressing public health needs.
To this end, HHS views its data is an enterprise resource, and not a
series of collections scattered across government silos.

The HHS CTO and Chief Information Officer (CIO) are leading information
technology (IT) enterprise-wide integration and modernization, working
closely with the CDO to create one umbrella as a unified Department with
shared, enterprise-wide capabilities to:

- **Eliminate silos to improve operational efficiencies:** Publishing
  its data assets in a centralized, secure data catalog in
  Healthdata.gov. Ensuring the data is machine-readable to the extent
  possible and Linking data through secure, cloud-based lake house
  interchanges
- **Accelerate scientific breakthroughs:** Unlocking the use of
  real-world data products and services to leads departments and
  agencies to develop new insights and enables Departments and HHS to
  make more informed evidence-based decisions. By bringing together
  program leads with shared goals and develop appropriate, cross-cutting
  to strategically advance the Department's most pressing public health
  priorities and solve the most critical operational needs as a result
  it will stream data related procurements.
- **Demystify government with transparency:** Strategically close
  interoperability gaps through cross-agency collaboration and
  establishment of common data terms and definitions and single "sources
  of truth". Promote data literacy across Department staff.
- **Drive new business models:** Enhances the Health Data marketplace
  features, by streamlining data procurements and third-party purchases.
  Eliminated need for conducting data calls, data use agreements by
  sharing data products and services built by various departments to
  address HHS's mission. Finding unified enterprise data management
  solutions and avoid the unnecessary use of countless non-communicating
  data platforms and analytic tools
- **Fuel American innovation:** Catalyzes the advancement in the
  specialized data products and services with access to high-value
  datasets developed by various departments. Such as optimize automation
  and ethical use of artificial intelligence tools to showcase
  specialized data services to eliminate redundant and duplicate
  activities around data cleanup, validation and data transformation.
- **Maximize taxpayers' ROI on HHS data investments:** Ensure that every
  dollar spent on data collection and management delivers measurable
  benefits to the American people. HHS Divisions shall use opportunities
  to collaborate and coordinate their data-driven public health
  activities through bringing together agency data leaders in venues
  such as the HHS Data Governance Board and HHS Data Council. Within
  these venues, agency data leaders will identify critical gaps and
  develop and implement plans to efficiently and effectively resolve
  them -- ultimately to ensure the proper stewardship of taxpayer
  dollars and optimal service to the public.

## Real-World Data for Impact

The entire "spirit" of the [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking
Act of
2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174), for
which the OPEN Government Data Act is Title II, is to ask and answer
questions (build evidence) to support policymaking---meaning that
federal agencies should collect, use, and acquire data to apply it in
ways for the betterment of the nation. This includes rigorous
application of the scientific method to test scientific hypotheses,
while following the data wherever the data lead. HHS, like all of
Federal government, should always use data to maximize the impact of
science, programs, and services for the common good.

Real-world data (RWD[^106]), sometimes called real-world evidence
(RWE[^107]), align with HHS Open Data values and goals to drive
healthcare innovation, transparency, and improved outcomes. HHS promotes
open access to and interoperability of RWD, including HIPAA-compliant
information from electronic health records, insurance claims, and
patient registries.

> Real-World Data provides a foundation for a "Learning Health System"
> that can rapidly adapt to changing circumstances, emergent diseases,
> and enable learning from the treatment of patients to inform others
> with the same condition.

This real-world approach enables diverse stakeholders, such as
regulators and payers, to gain insights from routine clinical care---the
real-world and provides a foundation for a "Learning Health System" that
can rapidly adapt to changing circumstances, emergent diseases, and
enable learning from the treatment of patients to inform others with the
same condition. By adopting "open by default", while safeguarding
individual privacy, HHS aims to leverage high-quality RWD/RWE, clinical
evidence regarding the usage, and potential benefits or risks, of a
medical product derived from analysis of RWD/RWE. Such interdisciplinary
analyses and results will inform regulatory decisions, evaluate
treatments, and accelerate effective care delivery, supporting
evidence-based policymaking and patient-centered healthcare.

At the core of the Living HHS Open Data Plan for RWD lies the concept
that data is a "public utility" for good that powers scientific
advancement, innovation, and progress. Public utilities exist because
the community has recognized that the service or product, they provide
is essential to the life and health of Americans. In today's world, the
public needs access to healthcare and public health data, which allows
individuals to take control of their own health and allows aggregate,
anonymized, deidentified data to be leveraged for innovation.

HHS supports public and private partnerships for data utility models
that increases data access for public consumers, including patients,
providers, payers, state agencies, and researchers. The health utility
concept is emerging today based on lessons learned from early gains by
Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), and by expanding the role of HIEs
into a public utility or Health Data Utilities (HDUs). HIEs have
provided critical and timely patient data to aid in treatment across
health care providers, but new governance models will be necessary to
empower patients and ensure HHS transparency, accountability, and
responsiveness to citizen prioritizes and real-world needs.

The on-going HIEs evolution into HDUs is opportunity for the HHS CDO and
partners to pilot novel data governance methods and pioneer new
approaches to interoperability. This progress with HIEs is informative
and important, yet alone it is not sufficient to enable a nationwide
learning health system. The CDO expects to pilot novel data governance
models with industry, academia, non-profit organizations, and all
sectors---including individuals with lived experiences, like patients
and caregivers, as partners---to co-create new modes of data governance
in collaboration with HHS.

In a learning health system, cancer treatment becomes more precise and
effective as clinicians can find other patients with similar tumor
characteristics, especially genomically similar tumors, and enable
clinicians to learn what treatments are or are not effective enabling
better and more tailored treatment with the right interventions, earlier
in the course of the disease. Similar use cases for the health public
utility exist for rare disease treatment; with sufficient data, the
health public utility can support much more rapid diagnosis and
treatment. Beyond the learning health system, such a public utility for
health data provides the foundation for improved bio-surveillance,
detection and analysis of adverse events from drugs, devices and
biologics, as well as for research. In some respects, more importantly,
such a public utility supports radical transparency for patients, both
in terms of expanding comprehensive access to their medical history and
for the ability of the public to understand how their data is being
used, by whom and to understand the benefits from that use of their
data.

A public utility model for good and radical transparency relies on a
Patient Trust Model. This model refers to the relationship between
patients and their healthcare organizations regarding their health
information. By providing patients control over their information and
data and allowing for permissioning of their data through a health data
utility creates the necessary components for a learning health system.
Key elements of the Patient Trust Model includes data security and
privacy, transparency and engagement, patient empowerment, and return of
results to improve healthcare, which is a goal for a learning health
system. In some ways this concept is similar to the Brazil\'s patient
data model that is governed by the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados
(LGPD)[^108]. The LGPD grants patients access control over their data
including data sharing and transparency on data use.

The health data utility model can also work to empower patients to take
control of their own data, share it selectively with their clinical care
team, and if willing, to opt in to specific research studies.

- **Standards:** HHS supports divisions to develop specific RWD
  standards, for example to meet a regulatory requirement. RWD should
  meet the three accepted metadata standards currently handled by
  Data.gov. Standards are also needed to facilitate the interoperability
  of data required to integrate disparate data sources, for example, it
  is likely that the emerging market pattern of HIEs becoming state
  based HPUs, will continue necessitating a federated approach to a
  national HPU resource.

- **Fit for purpose:** Agencies must ensure they have clear policies for
  evaluating and communicating the fitness-for-purpose, or sometimes
  called "fit for use", of RWD made available to the public. Agencies
  should supply adequate documentation for each released RWD to help
  users assess whether the data is suitable for their intended use.
  Practices may include creating a standard template or framework that
  offers users the necessary context and details and creation of
  mechanisms for transparent use of data and patient consent perhaps
  using an immutable ledger such as Blockchain.

- **Terms of Use:** RWD in the HHS ecosystem is open by default and
  should align with the privacy policy, data policy, and accessibility
  terms at Data.gov. When acquiring data, agencies should reduce the use
  of bespoke and custom terms in data use agreements, which would
  restrict ability to release data as Open Data. Agencies should
  consider multiple approaches to acquisitions and collection of data,
  including incorporating data agreements in the contracting or grant
  terms, and not in separate agreements. This can multiply the impact of
  federal funding, by ensuring that federal funding results in data
  available as a common good.

### Completed RWD Projects Advancing HHS Open Data

- FDA has a long history of using RWD and RWE to monitor and evaluate
  the post-market safety of authorized medical products. Advances in the
  availability and analysis of RWD have increased the potential for
  generating robust RWE to support regulatory decisions.

- Completed FDA initiatives recently focused on advancing the use of RWD
  and RWE in regulatory decision-making and on informing healthcare
  policy. FDA finalized guidance documents on use of RWE (including
  electronic health records (EHRs), medical claims data and registries)
  to support regulatory decisions for biologics, devices, and drugs.
  Recent FDA initiatives also cover study design considerations, and
  procedural and regulatory requirements.

- CMS released an updated guidance document in 2024 that describes
  coverage with evidence development (CED).

- CDC Data Channels exemplify open data principles by integrating
  diverse data sources into user-friendly visualizations and plain
  language interpretations. These channels empower the public with clear
  insights into issues related to infectious diseases, like [respiratory
  illnesses](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html),
  as well as other important health topics, such as [mental
  health](https://www.cdc.gov/mental-health/about-data/index.html).

- CDC's Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology has a
  dedicated team of data journalists, designers, and data experts that
  collaborate with CDC programs and emergency responses to design these
  channels, ensuring creation of audience-specific material and timely
  updates. Underlying data sources are made available at
  [data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/), enhancing transparency and
  enabling data reuse.

- CDC makes multiple other online data tools available to users. This
  includes [CDC WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) where users can create
  custom queries of vital records and other key public health data,
  providing them with up-to-date detailed information on health outcomes
  such as causes of death. By tailoring content and access points for
  various audiences, CDC enhances communication on urgent public health
  threats and accessibility to data to foster engagement and trust with
  the public.

### Ongoing RWD Initiatives Advancing HHS Open Data

- The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) is
  conducting market research for potential procurements for real world
  health care data and related services.

- With participation from multiple HHS divisions, the National Academy
  of Medicine has ongoing studies and convenings relating to the
  Learning Health System and Public Utility model and plan to issues
  reports and recommendations in the next year.

- The NIH is planning for the development of a RWD research platform to
  support research generally (e.g., National Clinical Cohort
  Collaborative \[N3C\]) with initial focus on the causes of Autism
  Spectrum Disorder (ASD). N3C infrastructure will also benefit other
  data-driven priorities like understanding nutrition for health,
  chronic diseases, environmental toxin exposures, and the benefits of
  healthy lifestyles.

- NIH/NCATS Open Data Portal was created to share and visualize data in
  real time to accelerate discover and guide the exploration of new
  therapeutic hypotheses. Open Data Portal is built to quickly pivot and
  share data for emerging public health needs and is expanding to
  include data for other diseases.

- FDA is committed to realizing the full potential of fit-for-purpose
  RWD to generate RWE that will advance the development of medical
  products and strengthen regulatory oversight of medical products
  across their lifecycle.
