## Appendix B: Open Science Disclosure Risk Management (2019 NSTC SOS)

This document was developed by the SOS working group on research protections in open science as a product of the “Workshop on Open Science Disclosure Risk Management” convened 
on July 22, 2019, at the Natcher Conference Center at the National Institutes of Health. The report highlights considerations and practices used to determine when data should 
be restricted or limited and gives recommendations to the Federal research community. This document will assist agencies in developing strategic objectives, training materials 
and other guidance documents when trying to manage disclosure risk in open science. A copy of the complete document can be accessed via the following link -
