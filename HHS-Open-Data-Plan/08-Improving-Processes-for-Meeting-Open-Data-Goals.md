## Improving Processes for Meeting Open Data Goals

Data is central to the HHS mission. Data is foundational to the Department, as all HHS Divisions work together to enhance the health and wellbeing of all Americans through HHS services, disease control and prevention, scientific advancements, and efficient regulation of food, drugs, medical products, and much more. As the HHS organization evolves, its data processes will change.  

Per the requirements of the OPEN Government Data Act[^66], the HHS CDO will update this section in a future version of the Living HHS Open Data Plan, following the Departmentâ€™s reorganization.
