## Improving Processes for Meeting Open Data Goals

Data is central to the HHS mission, which includes regulating food, drugs, medical products, and much more. Per the requirements of the OPEN Government Data Act[^33], 
the HHS CDO will update this section of the Living HHS Open Data Plan following the Department’s reorganization.

[^33]: OMB M-25-05, at 28-29.

> HHS agencies release data into “electronic reading rooms” once a low threshold of public inquiries is reached through FOIA requests –
[such as this site at HRSA](https://www.hrsa.gov/foia/electronic-reading).
