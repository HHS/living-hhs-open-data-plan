## Prioritizing Public Data Asset Review

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is committed to fostering innovation, transparency, and collaboration through our data-sharing initiatives. A critical 
component of an HHS Open Data Strategy will be to identify and publish priority public datasets, focusing on high-impact, transformative data resources.  

Criteria for prioritizing datasets may include:  

1. __Artificial Intelligence and Innovation:__ Datasets used to develop, test, or measure the performance of artificial intelligence systems, driving cutting-edge
   advancements in healthcare and human services.

2. __Public Impact and Mission Alignment:__ Information with significant potential to impact public health, further the core mission of HHS agencies, or meet critical needs
   of the Federal Government.

3. __Efficient Service and Benefit Delivery:__ Datasets supporting the delivery of essential services or benefits to the public, including information sharing to streamline,
   simplify, and improve HHS processes to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our programs.

4. __Scientific and Technological Progress:__ Data with high potential to spur innovation, accelerate science, or drive technological advancements in health and human
   services.

5. __High-Demand and Timely Topics:__ Datasets related to pressing public health issues may be subject to frequent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and are made
   visible to the public in the HHS FOIA Reading Room[^32]. This FOIA demand signal demonstrates high public interest or usage, and the HHS CDO evaluating how to use FOIA
   requests to help prioritize HHS Open Data workflows and department-wide processes.

We believe these focused criteria will ensure our data resources provide maximum value to our partners in the private sector, public institutions, and non-profit 
organizations. By prioritizing these high-impact datasets, we aim to facilitate groundbreaking research, inform critical policy decisions, and drive innovations that can 
transform healthcare and human services.  

We encourage all our partners to engage with these datasets and provide feedback on their utility and impact. Together, we can leverage the power of data to address critical 
health challenges, enhance service delivery, and improve the well-being of all Americans.
