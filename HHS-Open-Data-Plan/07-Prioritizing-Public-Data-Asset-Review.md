## Prioritizing Public Data Asset Review

A component of an HHS Open Data Strategy will be to identify and publish priority public datasets that matter to citizens. This will involve identifying and prioritizing high-impact, high-ROI data resources that align with HHS priorities for greatest benefit to society.  

Criteria for prioritizing datasets may include:  

1. **Artificial Intelligence and Innovation**: Datasets used to develop, test, or measure the performance of artificial intelligence systems, driving cutting-edge advancements in healthcare and human services.  
2. **Public Impact and Mission Alignment**: Information with significant potential to impact public health, further the core mission of HHS Divisions, or meet critical needs of the Federal government.  
3. **Efficient Service and Benefit Delivery**: Datasets supporting the delivery of essential services or benefits to the public, including information sharing to streamline, simplify, and improve HHS processes to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our programs.  
4. **Scientific and Technological Progress**: Data with high potential to spur innovation, accelerate science, or drive technological advancements in health and human services.
5. **High-Demand and Timely Topics**: Government information is subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and HHS makes its FOIA responses available to the public in each HHS Division’s [FOIA Library / Electronic Reading Room](https://www.hhs.gov/foia/electronic-reading-room/index.html)[^64][^65]. The HHS CDO is evaluating how to use FOIA requests to gauge public interest in different issues to help prioritize data workflows and department-wide processes. Issues of high public interest may appear as demand signals in FOIA requests, which could guide government to responsibly unlock information of greatest public interest. Similar logic and methods could also apply to submissions to the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG). Whether OIG complaints, FOIA requests, or other citizens’ suggestions, public input to HHS.gov should inform data-sharing efforts.

> HHS proactively publishes its FOIA responses as Open Data in "Electronic Reading Rooms," like the [HRSA Electronic Reading Room](https://www.hrsa.gov/foia/electronic-reading), once a low threshold of three or more public inquiries is met through FOIA requests. 

Data-driven approaches with focused criteria and standards will ensure HHS data sharing provides value to our partners in the private sector, public institutions, non-profit organizations, and beyond. By prioritizing high-impact datasets, we aim to facilitate groundbreaking research, inform policy decisions, and drive results while being responsive and agile with HHS Open Data to address the government service and healthcare issues of most importance to you.  

We encourage all our partners to engage with HHS Open Data and provide feedback on their utility and impact. Together, we can leverage the power of data to address critical health challenges, enhance service delivery, and improve the well-being of all Americans.
